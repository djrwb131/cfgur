 MAC Address      A multicast MAC address for which the switch has forwarding and or filtering information.
                  The format is two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, for example
                  01:23:45:67:89:AB. In an IVL system the MAC address will be displayed as a MAC
                  address and VLAN ID combination of 8 bytes.

 Type             The type of the entry. Static entries are those that are configured by the end user.
                  Dynamic entries are added to the table as a result of a learning process or protocol.

 Component        The component that is responsible for this entry in the Multicast Forwarding Database.
                  Possible values are IGMP Snooping, GMRP, and Static Filtering.

 Description      The text description of this multicast table entry.

 Interfaces       The list of interfaces that are designated for forwarding (Fwd:) and filtering (Flt:).

 Forwarding       The resultant forwarding list is derived from combining all the component's forwarding
 Interfaces       interfaces and removing the interfaces that are listed as the static filtering interfaces.
