show fiber-ports optics-info
This command displays the SFP vendor related information such as vendor name, serial
number of the SFP, part number of the SFP. The values are derived from the SFP's A0 table
using the I2C interface.

 Format        show fiber-ports optics-info {all | <slot/port>}

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

 Field                          Description

 Vendor Name                    The vendor name is a 16 character field that contains ASCII charac-
                                ters, left-aligned and padded on the right with ASCII spaces (20h). The
                                vendor name shall be the full name of the corporation, a commonly
                                accepted abbreviation of the name of the corporation, the SCSI com-
                                pany code for the corporation, or the stock exchange code for the cor-
                                poration.

 Length (50um, OM2)             This value specifies link length that is supported by the transceiver
                                while operating in compliance with applicable standards using 50
                                micron multimode OM2 [500MHz*km at 850nm] fiber. A value of zero
                                means that the transceiver does not support 50 micron multimode fiber
                                or that the length information must be determined from the transceiver
                                technology.

 Length (62.5um, OM1)           This value specifies link length that is supported by the transceiver
                                while operating in compliance with applicable standards using 62.5
                                micron multimode OM1 [200 MHz*km at 850nm, 500 MHz*km at
                                1310nm] fiber. A value of zero means that the transceiver does not
                                support 62.5 micron multimode fiber or that the length information must
                                determined from the transceiver technology

 Vendor SN                      The vendor serial number (vendor SN) is a 16 character field that con-
                                tains ASCII characters, left-aligned and padded on the right with ASCII
                                spaces (20h), defining the vendor's serial number for the transceiver. A
                                value of all zero in the 16-byte field indicates that the vendor SN is
                                unspecified.

 Vendor PN                      The vendor part number (vendor PN) is a 16-byte field that contains
                                ASCII characters, left aligned and added on the right with ASCII
                                spaces (20h), defining the vendor part number or product name. A
                                value of all zero in the 16-byte field indicates that the vendor PN is
                                unspecified.
