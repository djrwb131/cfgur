memory free low-watermark processor
Use this command to get notifications when the CPU free memory falls below the configured
threshold. A notification is generated when the free memory falls below the threshold.
Another notification is generated once the available free memory rises to 10 percent above
the specified threshold. To prevent generation of excessive notifications when the CPU free
memory fluctuates around the configured threshold, only one Rising or Falling memory
notification is generated over a period of 60 seconds. The threshold is specified in kilobytes.
The CPU free memory threshold configuration is saved across a switch reboot.
