 Default       0

 Format        storm-control multicast rate <0-14880000>

 Mode          Interface Config

no storm-control multicast rate

This command sets the multicast storm recovery threshold to the default value for an
interface and disables multicast storm recovery.

 Format        no storm-control multicast rate

 Mode          Interface Config

storm-control multicast (Global Config)
This command enables multicast storm recovery mode for all interfaces. If the mode is
enabled, multicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of L2 multicast traffic ingressing on
an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic will be dropped. Therefore,
the rate of multicast traffic will be limited to the configured threshold.

 Default       disabled

 Format        storm-control multicast

 Mode          Global Config

no storm-control multicast

This command disables multicast storm recovery mode for all interfaces.

 Format        no storm-control multicast

 Mode          Global Config

storm-control multicast level (Global Config)
This command configures the multicast storm recovery threshold for all interfaces as a
percentage of link speed and enables multicast storm recovery mode. If the mode is enabled,
multicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of L2 multicast traffic ingressing on an
interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic will be dropped. Therefore,
the rate of multicast traffic will be limited to the configured threshold.

 Default       5

 Format        storm-control multicast level <0-100>
