poe reset
Use this command to reset the PoE state of every port (in global mode) or a specific port (in
interface mode). When the PoE port status is shown to be in an error state, this command
can be used to reset the PoE port. The command can also reset the power-delivering ports.
Note that this command takes effect only once after it is executed and cannot be saved
across power cycles.

poe timer schedule name
Use this command to allow you to attach a timer schedule to a PoE port.
You can define a time schedule using the existing time range commands. This schedule has
start and stop times. When this timer schedule is applied to a PoE-enabled port, the
capability of the port to deliver power is affected. At the scheduled start time, the PoE port is
disabled such that it cannot deliver any power. At the scheduled stop time, the PoE port is
reenabled so that it can deliver power.

    Note: For information about creating a timer schedule, see Time Range
            Commands for Time-Based ACLs on page 309.
