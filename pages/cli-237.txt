show dhcp lease
Use this command to display a list of IPv4 addresses currently leased from a DHCP server
on a specific in-band interface or all in-band interfaces. This command does not apply to
service or network ports.

 Format       show dhcp lease [interface <slot/port>]

 Mode         Privileged EXEC

 Term                Definition

 IP address, Subnet  The IP address and network mask leased from the DHCP server.
 mask

 DHCP Lease          The IPv4 address of the DHCP server that leased the address.
 server

 State               State of the DHCPv4 Client on this interface.

 DHCP transaction    The transaction ID of the DHCPv4 Client.
 ID

 Lease               The time (in seconds) that the IP address was leased by the server.

 Renewal             The time (in seconds) when the next DHCP renew Request is sent by DHCPv4 Client
                     to renew the leased IP address.

 Rebind              The time (in seconds) when the DHCP Rebind process starts.

 Retry count         Number of times the DHCPv4 client sends a DHCP REQUEST message before the
                     server responds.

ip route
This command configures a static route.   The <ipaddr> parameter is a valid IP address,
and <subnetmask> is a valid subnet mask. The <nexthopip> parameter is a valid IP
address of the next hop router. Specifying Null0 as nexthop parameter adds a static reject
route. The optional <preference> parameter is an integer (value from 1 to 255) that allows
you to specify the preference value (sometimes called "administrative distance") of an
individual static route. Among routes to the same destination, the route with the lowest
preference value is the route entered into the forwarding database. By specifying the
preference of a static route, you control whether a static route is more or less preferred than
routes from dynamic routing protocols. The preference also controls whether a static route is
more or less preferred than other static routes to the same destination. A route with a
preference of 255 cannot be used to forward traffic.
For the static routes to be visible, you must perform the following steps:
·   Enable IP routing globally.
·   Enable IP routing for the interface.
·   Confirm that the associated link is also up
