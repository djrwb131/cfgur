storm-control unicast rate (Global Config)
Use this command to configure the unicast storm recovery threshold for all interfaces in
packets per second. If the mode is enabled, unicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of
L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the
traffic is dropped. Therefore, the rate of unicast traffic is limited to the configured threshold.
