 Term              Description

 Admin Mode        Indicates whether or not MLD Snooping Querier is active on the switch.

 Admin Version     Indicates the version of MLD that will be used while sending out the queries. This is
                   defaulted to MLD v1 and it cannot be changed.

 Querier Address   Shows the IP address which will be used in the IPv6 header while sending out MLD
                   queries. It can be configured using the appropriate command.

 Query Interval    Shows the amount of time in seconds that a Snooping Querier waits before sending
                   out the periodic general query.

 Querier Timeout   Displays the amount of time to wait in the Non-Querier operational state before moving
                   to a Querier state.

 Term              Description

 VLAN Admin Mode   Indicates whether MLD Snooping Querier is active on the VLAN.

 VLAN Operational  Indicates whether MLD Snooping Querier is in "Querier" or "Non-Querier" state. When
 State             the switch is in Querier state, it will send out periodic general queries. When in
                   Non-Querier state, it will wait for moving to Querier state and does not send out any
                   queries.

 Operational Max   Indicates the time to wait before removing a Leave from a host upon receiving a Leave
 Response Time     request. This value is calculated dynamically from the Queries received from the
                   network. If the Snooping Switch is in Querier state, then it is equal to the configured
                   value.
