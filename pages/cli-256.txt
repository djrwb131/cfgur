no ip helper-address (Global Config)

Use this command to remove the IP address from the previously configured list. The no
command without an <ip-address> argument removes the entire list of helper addresses
on that interface.

 Format      no ip helper-address <ip-address> {<dest-udp-port> | dhcp | domain |
             isakmp | mobile-ip | nameserver | netbios-dgm | netbios-ns | ntp |
             pim-auto-rip | rip | tacacs | tftp | time}

 Mode        GlobalConfig

ip helper enable
Use this command to enable relay of UDP packets. This command can be used to
temporarily disable IP helper without deleting all IP helper addresses. This command
replaces the bootpdhcprelay enable command, but affects not only relay of DHCP
packets, but also relay of any other protocols for which an IP helper address has been
configured.

 Default     disabled

ip helper-address (Interface Config)
Use this command to add a unicast helper address to the list of helper addresses on an
interface. This is the address of a DHCP server. This command can be applied multiple times
on the routing interface to form the helper addresses list until the list reaches the maximum
supported helper addresses.

 Default     No helper addresses are configured.

 Format      ip helper-address <ip-address> [<dest-udp-port> | dhcp | domain |
             isakmp | mobile-ip | nameserver | netbios-dgm | netbios-ns | ntp |
             pim-auto-rip | rip | tacacs | tftp | time]
