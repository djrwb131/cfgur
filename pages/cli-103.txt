no storm-control multicast level

This command sets the multicast storm recovery threshold to the default value for all
interfaces and disables multicast storm recovery.

 Format      no storm-control multicast level

 Mode        Global Config

storm-control multicast rate (Global Config)
Use this command to configure the multicast storm recovery threshold for all interfaces in
packets per second. If the mode is enabled, multicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate
of L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold,
the traffic is dropped. Therefore, the rate of multicast traffic is limited to the configured
threshold.

 Default     0

 Format      storm-control multicast rate <0-14880000>

 Mode        Global Config

no storm-control broadcast rate

This command sets the broadcast storm recovery threshold to the default value for all
interfaces and disables broadcast storm recovery.

 Format      no storm-control broadcast rate

 Mode        Global Config

storm-control unicast (Interface Config)
This command enables unicast storm recovery mode for an interface. If the mode is enabled,
unicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of unknown L2 unicast (destination lookup
failure) traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the
traffic will be dropped. Therefore, the rate of unknown unicast traffic will be limited to the
configured threshold.

 Default     disabled

 Format      storm-control unicast

 Mode        Interface Config
