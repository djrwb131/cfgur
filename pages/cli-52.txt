vlan protocol group
This command adds protocol-based VLAN groups to the system. When it is created, the
protocol group will be assigned a unique number (1-128) that will be used to identify the
group in subsequent commands.

 Format        vlan protocol group <1-128>

 Mode          Global Config

vlan protocol group name

can be a character string of 0­16 characters.

 Format        vlan protocol group name <1-128> <groupname>

 Mode          Global Config

vlan protocol group add protocol
This command adds the protocol to the protocol-based VLAN identified by groupid. A group
may have more than one protocol associated with it. Each interface and protocol combination
can only be associated with one group. If adding a protocol to a group causes any conflicts
with interfaces currently associated with the group, this command fails and the protocol is not
added to the group. The possible values for protocol-list includes the keywords ip, arp, and
ipx and hexadecimal or decimal values ranging from 0x0600 (1536) to 0xFFFF (65535). The
protocol list can accept up to 16 protocols separated by a comma.

 Default       none

 Format        vlan protocol group add protocol <groupid> <ethertype>
               {<protocol-list> | arp | ip | ipx}

 Mode          Global Config
