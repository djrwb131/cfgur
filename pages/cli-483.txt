aaa accounting
The command creates an accounting method list. This list is identified by the default
keyword or by a user-specified <list-name>. Accounting records, when enabled for a
line-mode, can be sent at both the beginning and at the end (start-stop) or only at the end
(stop-only). If none is specified, accounting is disabled for the specified list. If tacacs is
specified as the accounting method, accounting records are notified to a TACACS+ server. If
radius is the specified accounting method, accounting records are notified to a RADIUS
server.
For the same set of accounting type and list name, the administrator can change the record
type or the methods list without having to first delete the previous configuration.
Note the following:
·  A maximum of five accounting method lists can be created for each exec and commands
    type.
·   The same list-name can be used for both exec and commands accounting type.
·  AAA accounting for commands with RADIUS as the accounting method is not supported.

 Format      aaa accounting {exec | commands} {default | <list-name>} {start-stop
             | stop-only | none} <method1> [<method2>...]
