DHCP L2 Relay Agent Commands

   You can enable the switch to operate as a DHCP Layer 2 relay agent to relay DHCP requests
   from clients to a Layer 3 relay agent or server. The Circuit ID and Remote ID can be added to
   DHCP requests relayed from clients to a DHCP server. This information is included in DHCP
   Option 82, as specified in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of RFC3046.

   dhcp l2relay
   Use this command to enable the DHCP Layer 2 Relay agent for an interface, a range of
   interfaces, or all interfaces. The subsequent commands mentioned in this section can be
   used only when the DHCP L2 relay is enabled.

     Format      dhcp l2relay

     Modes       · Global Config
                 · Interface Config

   no dhcp l2relay

   Use this command to disable the DHCP Layer 2 relay agent for an interface or range of
   interfaces.

     Format      no dhcp l2relay

     Modes       · Global Config
                 · Interface Config

   dhcp l2relay circuit-id vlan
   Use this parameter to set the DHCP Option-82 Circuit ID for a VLAN. When enabled, the
   interface number is added as the Circuit ID in DHCP option 82. Vlan-list range is 1­4093.
   Separate non-consecutive IDs with a comma (,), and do not insert spaces or zeros in
   between the range. Use a dash (­) for the range.

     Format      dhcp l2relay circuit-id vlan <vlan-list>

     Mode        Global Config

   no dhcp l2relay circuit-id vlan

   Use this parameter to clear the DHCP Option-82 Circuit ID for a VLAN.

     Format      no dhcp l2relay circuit-id vlan <vlan-list>

     Mode        Global Config
