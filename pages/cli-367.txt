traceroute ipv6
Use the traceroute command to discover the routes that packets actually take when
traveling to their destination through the network on a hop-by-hop basis. The IPv6 address or
host name must be a valid. The optional <port> parameter is the UDP port used as the
destination of packets sent as part of the traceroute. This port should be an unused port on
the destination system. The range for <port> is zero (0) to 65535. The default value is
33434.

 Default       port: 33434
