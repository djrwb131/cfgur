dot1x timeout
This command sets the value, in seconds, of the timer used by the authenticator state
machine on this port. Depending on the token used and the value (in seconds) passed,
various time-out configurable parameters are set.

 Default          guest-vlan-period: 90 seconds
                  reauth-period: 3600 seconds
                  quiet-period: 60 seconds
                  tx-period: 30 seconds
                  supp-timeout: 30 seconds
                  server-timeout: 30 seconds

 Format         dot1x timeout {{guest-vlan-period <seconds>} | {reauth-period
                <seconds>} | {quiet-period <seconds>} | {tx-period <seconds>} |
                {supp-timeout <seconds>} | {server-timeout <seconds>}}

 Mode           Interface Config

The following table describes the tokens that are supported.

 Tokens              Definition

 guest-vlan-period   The time, in seconds, for which the authenticator waits to see if any EAPOL packets are
                     received on a port before authorizing the port and placing the port in the guest vlan (if
                     configured). The guest vlan timer is only relevant when guest vlan has been configured
                     on that specific port.

 reauth-period       The value, in seconds, of the timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port
                     to determine when re-authentication of the supplicant takes place. The reauth-period
                     must be a value in the range 1 - 65535.
