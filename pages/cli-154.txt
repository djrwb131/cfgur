IGMP Snooping Configuration Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure IGMP snooping. The software
   supports IGMP Versions 1, 2, and 3. The IGMP snooping feature can help conserve
   bandwidth because it allows the switch to forward IP multicast traffic only to connected hosts
   that request multicast traffic. IGMPv3 adds source filtering capabilities to IGMP versions 1
   and 2.
