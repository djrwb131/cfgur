Port Configuration Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to view and configure port settings.

   interface
   This command gives you access to the Interface Config mode, which allows you to enable or
   modify the operation of an interface (port).

     Format     interface <slot/port>

     Mode       Global Config

   interface vlan
   This command gives you access to the vlan virtual interface mode, which allows certain port
   configurations (for example, the IP address) to be applied to the VLAN interface. Type a
   question mark (?) after entering the interface configuration mode to see the available options.

     Format     interface vlan <vlan id>

     Mode       Global Config

   interface lag
   This command gives you access to the LAG (link aggregation, or port channel) virtual
   interface, which allows certain port configurations to be applied to the LAG interface. Type a
   question mark (?) after entering the interface configuration mode to see the available options.

       Note: The IP address cannot be assigned to a LAG virtual interface. The
             interface must be put under a VLAN group and an IP address
             assigned to the VLAN group.

     Format     interface lag <lag id>

     Mode       Global Config

   auto-negotiate
   This command enables automatic negotiation on a port.

     Default    enabled

     Format     auto-negotiate

     Mode       Interface Config
