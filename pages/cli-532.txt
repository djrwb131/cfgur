10. Log Messages                                         10

   This chapter lists common log messages, along with information regarding the cause of each
   message. There is no specific action that can be taken per message. If a problem is being
   diagnosed, a set of these messages in the event log, along with an understanding of the system
   configuration and details of the problem, can assist NETGEAR technical support in determining
   the root cause of such a problem.
