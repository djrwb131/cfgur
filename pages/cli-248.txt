show ip route summary
Use this command to display the routing table summary. Use the optional all parameter to
show the number of all routes, including best and non-best routes. To include only the
number of best routes, do not use the optional parameter.
If you enter the optional all keyword, some statistics, such as the number of routes from
each source, include counts for alternate routes. An alternate route is a route that is not the
most preferred route to its destination and therefore is not installed in the forwarding table.
If you do not enter the optional all keyword, the output reports only the best routes.
