police-two-rate
This command is the two-rate form of the police command and is used to establish the
traffic policing style for the specified class. For each outcome, the only possible actions are
drop, set-cos-as-sec-cos, set-cos-transmit, set-sec-cos-transmit, set-dscp-transmit,
set-prec-transmit, or transmit. In this two-rate form of the police command, the conform
action defaults to send, the exceed action defaults to drop, and the violate action defaults to
drop. These actions can be set with this command after the style is configured.
