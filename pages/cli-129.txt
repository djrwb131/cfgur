Static MAC Filtering Commands

   The commands in this section describe how to configure static MAC filtering. Static MAC
   filtering allows you to configure destination ports for a static multicast MAC filter irrespective
   of the platform.

   macfilter
   This command adds a static MAC filter entry for the MAC address <macaddr> on the VLAN
   <vlanid>. A packet with a specific destination MAC address in a specific VLAN is admitted
   only if the ingress port is defined in the set of source ports, otherwise the packet is dropped.
   On the egress side, a packet that was admitted is sent through all ports that are defined in
   the set of destination ports.
   The value of the <macaddr> parameter is a 6-byte hexadecimal number in the format of
   b1:b2:b3:b4:b5:b6. The following MAC addresses are restricted: 00:00:00:00:00:00,
   01:80:C2:00:00:00 to 01:80:C2:00:00:0F, 01:80:C2:00:00:20 to 01:80:C2:00:00:21, and
   FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. The <vlanid> parameter must identify a valid VLAN.
   The number of static mac filters supported on the system is different for MAC filters where
   source ports are configured and MAC filters where destination ports are configured.
      For unicast MAC address filters and multicast MAC address filters with source port lists,
       the maximum number of static MAC filters supported is 20.
      For multicast MAC address filters with destination ports configured, the maximum number
       of static filters supported is 256.
   For example, for current platforms you can configure the following combinations:
      Unicast MAC and source port (max = 20)
      Multicast MAC and source port (max=20)
      Multicast MAC and destination port (only) (max=256)
      Multicast MAC and source ports and destination ports (max=20)

     Format     macfilter <macaddr> <vlanid>

     Mode       Global Config

   no macfilter

   This command removes all filtering restrictions and the static MAC filter entry for the MAC
   address <macaddr> on the VLAN <vlanid>. The <macaddr> parameter must be specified
   as a 6-byte hexadecimal number in the format of b1:b2:b3:b4:b5:b6.
   The <vlanid> parameter must identify a valid VLAN.

     Format     no macfilter <macaddr> <vlanid>

     Mode       Global Config
