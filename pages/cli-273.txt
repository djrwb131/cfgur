                              M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

    Note: The optional keywords [ipv4 | ipv6] specify the Layer 3 protocol
            for this class. If not specified, this parameter defaults to ipv4. This
            maintains backward compatibility for configurations defined on
            systems before IPv6 match items were supported.

    Note: The CLI mode is changed to Class-Map Config or Ipv6-Class-Map
            Config when this command is successfully executed depending on
            the [ipv4 | ipv6] keyword specified.

 Format        class-map match-all <class-map-name> [ipv4 | ipv6]

 Mode          Global Config

no class-map

This command eliminates an existing DiffServ class. The <class-map-name> is the name
of an existing DiffServ class. (The class name "default" is reserved and is not allowed here.)
This command might be issued at any time; if the class is currently referenced by one or
more policies or by any other class, the delete action fails.

 Format        no class-map <class-map-name>

 Mode          Global Config

class-map rename
This command changes the name of a DiffServ class. The <class-map-name> is the
name of an existing DiffServ class. The <new-class-map-name> parameter is a
case-sensitive alphanumeric string from 1 to 31 characters uniquely identifying the class.

 Default       none

 Format        class-map rename <class-map-name> <new-class-map-name>

 Mode          Global Config

match ethertype
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the value of
the ethertype. The ethertype value is specified as a <keyword> argument that can be one
of the following types: appletalk, arp, ibmsna, ipv4, ipv6, ipx, mplsmcast,
mplsucast, netbios, novell, pppoe, or rarp or as a <range> argument that
represents an EtherType value in the range of 0x0600-0xFFFF.
