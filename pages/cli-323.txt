poe usagethreshold
Use this command to set a threshold (as a percentage) for the total amount of power that can
be delivered by the switch. For example, if the switch can deliver up to a maximum of 300
watts, a usage threshold of 90 percent ensures that only 270 watts are used for delivering
power to devices. This ensures that more power is not drawn than the switch can provide.
When the usage threshold is set, all the PDs are brought down and then brought back up. If
the consumed power is less than the threshold power (in the preceding case, 270 watts),
then the devices continue to power up. If the consumed power is 269 watts or less, the next
device is powered up. The moment consumed power exceeds the threshold power
(270 watts), no other devices can power up.
This command allows you to set the usage threshold based on each individual PoE unit or all
PoE units.

 Default      90

 Format       poe usagethreshold {<unit> | all} <1-99>

 Mode         Global Config

no poe usagethreshold

Use this command to set the usage threshold to a default value.

 Format       no poe usagethreshold {<unit> | all}

poe traps
Use this command to enable logging of specific PoE-related events, such as a PoE port
powering a device, the threshold being exceeded, and so on.

 Default      Enable
