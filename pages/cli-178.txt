Port Security Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure Port Security on the switch. Port
   security, which is also known as port MAC locking, allows you to secure the network by
   locking allowable MAC addresses on a port. Packets with a matching source MAC address
   are forwarded normally, and all other packets are discarded.

       Note: To enable the SNMP trap specific to port security, see snmp-server
                  enable traps violation on page 494.
