                            M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

       Note: This command fails if any attributes within the policy definition exceed
               the capabilities of the interface. Once a policy is successfully attached
               to an interface, any attempt to change the policy definition, that would
               result in a violation of the interface capabilities, causes the policy
               change attempt to fail.

     Format       service-policy {in | out} <policymapname>

       Note: Each interface can have one policy attached.

   no service-policy

   This command detaches a policy from an interface in the inbound direction. The
   <policyname> parameter is the name of an existing DiffServ policy.

       Note: This command causes a service to remove its reference to the policy.
               This command effectively disables DiffServ on an interface in the
               inbound direction. There is no separate interface administrative
               'mode' command for DiffServ.

     Format       no service-policy in <policymapname>

     Modes           Global Config
                     Interface Config
