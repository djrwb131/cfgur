TACACS+ Commands

   TACACS+ provides access control for networked devices via one or more centralized
   servers. Similar to RADIUS, this protocol simplifies authentication by making use of a single
   database that can be shared by many clients on a large network. TACACS+ is based on the
   TACACS protocol (described in RFC1492) but additionally provides for separate
   authentication, authorization, and accounting services. The original protocol was UDP based
   with messages passed in clear text over the network. TACACS+ uses TCP to ensure reliable
   delivery and a shared key configured on the client and daemon server to encrypt all
   messages.
