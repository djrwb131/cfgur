Energy-Detect Mode

   When Energy-Detect mode is enabled, if communication on a port stops, the port circuitry
   automatically shuts down for a short period. The port wakes up periodically to check for link
   activity. If activity is detected, the port circuitry remains active. This allows performing
   autonegotiation and saving power when there is no active link.

       Note: Combination ports support both copper and fiber media. Energy
               Detect mode only applies to copper media. If Energy Detect mode is
               configured on a combination port, it will only function when a copper
               media is active.
