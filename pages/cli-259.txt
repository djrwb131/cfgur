 Term                  Definition

 DHCP client           The number of valid messages received from a DHCP client. The count is
 messages received     incremented only if IP helper is enabled globally, the ingress routing interface is up,
                       and the packet passes a number of validity checks, such as having a TTL>1 and
                       having valid source and destination IP addresses.

 DHCP client           The number of DHCP client messages relayed to a server. If a message is relayed
 messages relayed      to multiple servers, the count is incremented once for each server.

 DHCP server           The number of DHCP responses received from the DHCP server. This count
 messages received     includes only messages that the DHCP server unicasts to the relay agent for relay
                       to the client.

 DHCP server           The number of DHCP server messages relayed to a client.
 messages relayed

 UDP clients           The number of valid UDP packets received. This count includes DHCP messages
 messages received     and all other protocols relayed. Conditions are similar to those for the first statistic in
                       this table.

 UDP clients           The number of UDP packets relayed. This count includes DHCP messages relayed
 messages relayed      as well as all other protocols. The count is incremented for each server to which a
                       packet is sent.

 DHCP message hop      The number of DHCP client messages received whose hop count is larger than the
 count exceeded max    maximum allowed. The maximum hop count is a configurable value listed in show
                       bootpdhcprelay. A log message is written for each such failure. The DHCP relay
                       agent does not relay these packets.

 DHCP message with     The number of DHCP client messages received whose secs field is less than the
 secs field below min  minimum value. The minimum secs value is a configurable value and is displayed in
                       show bootpdhcprelay. A log message is written for each such failure. The DHCP
                       relay agent does not relay these packets.

 DHCP message with     The number of DHCP client messages received whose gateway address, giaddr, is
 giaddr set to local   already set to an IP address configured on one of the relay agent's own IP
 address               addresses. In this case, another device is attempting to spoof the relay agent's
                       address. The relay agent does not relay such packets. A log message gives details
                       for each occurrence.

 Packets with expired  The number of packets received with TTL of 0 or 1 that might otherwise have been
 TTL                   relayed.

 Packets that matched  The number of packets ignored by the relay agent because they match a discard
 a discard entry       relay entry.
