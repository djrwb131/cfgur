IP Access Control List (ACL) Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure IP ACL settings. IP ACLs ensure
   that only authorized users have access to specific resources and block any unwarranted
   attempts to reach network resources.
   The following rules apply to IP ACLs:
   ·   Managed switch software does not support IP ACL configuration for IP packet fragments.
   ·   The maximum number of ACLs you can create is hardware-dependent. The limit applies
       to all ACLs, regardless of type.
   ·   The maximum number of rules per IP ACL is hardware-dependent.
