    Note: An implicit deny all IP rule always terminates the access list.

    Note: The mirror parameter allows traffic matching this rule to be copied
           to the specified <slot/port>, while the redirect parameter allows
           traffic matching this rule to be forwarded to the specified
           <slot/port>. The assign-queue and redirect parameters are
           valid only for a permit rule.

A rule might either deny or permit traffic according to the specified classification fields. At a
minimum, either every keyword or the protocol, source address, and destination address
values must be specified. The source and destination IP address fields might be specified
using the keyword any to indicate a match on any value in that field. The remaining
command parameters are all optional, but the most frequently used parameters appear in the
same relative order as shown in the command format.
The assign-queue parameter allows specification of a particular hardware queue for
handling traffic that matches this rule. The allowed <queue-id> value is 0-(n-1), where n is
the number of user configurable queues available for the hardware platform. The
assign-queue parameter is valid only for a permit rule.
The time-range parameter allows imposing time limitation on the IP ACL rule as defined by
the parameter <time-range-name>. If a time range with the specified name does not exist
and the IP ACL containing this ACL rule is applied to an interface or bound to a VLAN, then
the ACL rule is applied immediately. If a time range with specified name exists and the IP
ACL containing this ACL rule is applied to an interface or bound to a VLAN, then the ACL rule
is applied when the time range with specified name becomes active. The ACL rule is
removed when the time range with specified name becomes inactive.
You can specify a simple rate limiter for packets matching an ACL permit rule. You must
specify the burst size in kbytes and allowed rate of traffic in kbps. The conforming traffic is
allowed to transmit, and non-conforming traffic is dropped. This action is ignored for any
deny rule, since by definition matching packets are dropped.
