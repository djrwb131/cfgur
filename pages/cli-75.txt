set garp timer leaveall
This command sets how frequently Leave All PDUs are generated. A Leave All PDU
indicates that all registrations will be unregistered. Participants would need to rejoin in order
to maintain registration. The value applies per port and per GARP participation. The time
may range from 200 to 6000 (centiseconds). The value 1000 centiseconds is 10 seconds.
You can use this command on all ports (Global Config mode) or a single port (Interface
