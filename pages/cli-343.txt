show fiber-ports optics
This command displays the diagnostics information of the SFP such as temperature, voltage,
current, input power, output power, Tx fault, and LOS. The values are derived from the SFP's
A2 (Diagnostics) table using the I2C interface.

 Format          show fiber-ports optics {all | <slot/port>}

 Mode            Privileged EXEC

 Field                            Description

 Temp                             Internally measured transceiver temperature.

 Voltage                          Internally measured supply voltage.

 Current                          Measured TX bias current.

 Output Power                     Measured optical output power relative to 1mW.

 Input Power                      Measured optical power received relative to 1mW.

 TX Fault                         Transmitter fault.

 LOS                              Loss of signal.
