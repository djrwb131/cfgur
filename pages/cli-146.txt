 Term           Definition

 Interface      Interface address in slot/port format.

 Filter Type    Is one of two values:
                   ip-mac: User has configured MAC address filtering on this interface.
                   ip: Only IP address filtering on this interface.

 IP Address     IP address of the interface

 MAC Address    If MAC address filtering is not configured on the interface, the MAC Address field is
                empty. If port security is disabled on the interface, then the MAC Address field displays
                "permit-all."

 VLAN           The VLAN for the binding rule.
