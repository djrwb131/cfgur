no storm-control unicast

This command disables unicast storm recovery mode for an interface.

 Format        no storm-control unicast

 Mode          Interface Config

storm-control unicast level (Interface Config)
This command configures the unicast storm recovery threshold for an interface as a
percentage of link speed, and enables unicast storm recovery. If the mode is enabled, unicast
storm recovery is active, and if the rate of unknown L2 unicast (destination lookup failure)
traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic will be
dropped. Therefore, the rate of unknown unicast traffic will be limited to the configured
threshold. This command also enables unicast storm recovery mode for an interface.

 Default       5

 Format        storm-control unicast level <0-100>

 Mode          Interface Config

no storm-control unicast level

This command sets the unicast storm recovery threshold to the default value for an interface
and disables unicast storm recovery.

 Format        no storm-control unicast level

 Mode          Interface Config

storm-control unicast rate (Interface Config)
Use this command to configure the unicast storm recovery threshold for an interface in
packets per second. If the mode is enabled, unicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of
L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the
traffic is dropped. Therefore, the rate of unicast traffic is limited to the configured threshold.

 Default       0

 Format        storm-control unicast rate <0-14880000>

 Mode          Interface Config
