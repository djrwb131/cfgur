Telnet Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure and view Telnet settings. You can
   use Telnet to manage the device from a remote management host.

   ip telnet server enable
   Use this command to enable Telnet connections to the system and to enable the Telnet
   Server Admin Mode. This command opens the Telnet listening port.

     Default        enabled

     Format         ip telnet server enable

     Mode           Privileged EXEC

   no ip telnet server enable

   sessions.

   telnet
   Use this command to establish a new outbound Telnet connection to a remote host. The host
   must be a valid IP address or host name. The value for <port> is a valid decimal integer in
   the range of 0­65,535, where the default value is 23. If the optional debug parameter is
   used, the current Telnet options enabled is displayed. The optional line parameter sets the
   outbound Telnet operational mode as linemode (by default, the operational mode is character
   mode). The optional noecho parameter disables local echo.
