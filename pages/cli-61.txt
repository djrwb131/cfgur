The native VLAN must be in the allowed VLAN list for tagging of received untagged packets.
Otherwise, untagged packets are discarded. Packets marked with the native VLAN are
transmitted untagged from the trunk port. The default ID is 1, the default VLAN.

 Default       1 (default VLAN)

 Format        switchport trunk native vlan <vlan-id>

 Mode          Interface Config

no switchport trunk native vlan

Use this command to reset the trunk mode native VLAN of the switch port to its default value.

 Format        no switchport trunk native vlan

 Mode          Interface Config

switchport access vlan
Use this command to configure the VLAN on the access port. You can assign one VLAN only
to the access port. The access port is member of VLAN 1 by default. You can assign the
access port to a VLAN other than VLAN 1. If you remove the access VLAN on the switch, the
access port becomes a member of VLAN 1. If you configure the access port as a member of
a VLAN that does not exist, an error occurs and the configuration does not change.

 Default       1 (default VLAN)

 Format        switchport access vlan <vlan-id>

 Mode          Interface Config

no switchport access vlan

This command resets the switch port access mode VLAN to its default value.

 Format        no switchport access vlan

 Mode          Interface Config

show interfaces switchport
Use this command to either display the switch port status for all interfaces, for a specific
interface, or for a specific mode (access, trunk, or general). If you select a mode but do not
specify the interface for the mode, the selected mode is displayed for all interfaces.

 Format        show interfaces switchport {[<slot/port>] | {access | trunk |
               general} [<slot/port>]}

 Mode          Privileged EXEC
