 Mode         Mac-Access-List Config

mac access-group
This command either attaches a specific MAC access control list (ACL) identified by <name>
to an interface, or associates it with a VLAN ID in a specific direction. The <name> parameter
must be the name of an existing MAC ACL.
An optional sequence number might be specified to indicate the order of this mac access list
relative to other mac access lists already assigned to this interface and direction. A lower
number indicates higher precedence order. If a sequence number is already in use for this
interface and direction, the specified mac access list replaces the currently attached mac
access list using that sequence number. If the sequence number is not specified for this
command, a sequence number that is one greater than the highest sequence number
currently in use for this interface and direction is used.
This command specified in Interface Config mode only affects a single interface, whereas the
Global Config mode setting is applied to all interfaces. The VLAN keyword is only valid in the
Global Config mode. The Interface Config mode command is available only on platforms that
support independent per-port Class of Service queue configuration.
