set igmp
This command enables IGMP Snooping on the system (Global Config Mode) or an interface
(Interface Config Mode). This command also enables IGMP snooping on a particular VLAN
(VLAN Config Mode) and can enable IGMP snooping on all interfaces participating in a
VLAN.
If an interface has IGMP Snooping enabled and you enable this interface for routing or enlist
it as a member of a port-channel (LAG), IGMP Snooping functionality is disabled on that
interface. IGMP Snooping functionality is re-enabled if you disable routing or remove
port-channel (LAG) membership from an interface that has IGMP Snooping enabled.
The IGMP application supports the following activities:
   Validation of the IP header checksum (as well as the IGMP header checksum) and
    discarding of the frame upon checksum error.
   Maintenance of the forwarding table entries based on the MAC address versus the IP
    address.
   Flooding of unregistered multicast data packets to all ports in the VLAN.

This command enables IGMP Snooping on all interfaces. If an interface has IGMP Snooping
enabled and you enable this interface for routing or enlist it as a member of a port-channel

functionality is re-enabled if you disable routing or remove port-channel (LAG) membership
from an interface that has IGMP Snooping enabled.
