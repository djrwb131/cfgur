domain-name (Global Config)
The managed switch supports authentication based on domain name, in addition to the user
name and password. This command allows the switch to be configured in a domain. Users
can enable or disable domain functionality:
·   Domain enabled. In this case, when the user enters only the user name, the managed
    switch sends the domain name that is configured on the switch and the user name that
    the user enters in the format "domainname\username" to the RADIUS server.
    If the user enters the domain name and user name, the managed switch sends the
    domain name and user name that the user enters in the format "domainname\username"
    to the RADIUS server.
·   Domain disabled. In this case, the domain name is not included when the user name is
    sent to the RADIUS server.
