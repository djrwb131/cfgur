Dynamic ARP Inspection Commands

   Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature that rejects invalid and malicious ARP
   packets. DAI prevents a class of man-in-the-middle attacks, where an unfriendly station
   intercepts traffic for other stations by poisoning the ARP caches of its unsuspecting
   neighbors. The miscreant sends ARP requests or responses mapping another station's IP
   address to its own MAC address.
   DAI relies on DHCP snooping. DHCP snooping listens to DHCP message exchanges and
   builds a binding database of valid (MAC address, IP address, VLAN, and interface) tuples.
   When DAI is enabled, the switch drops ARP packets whose sender MAC address and
   sender IP address do not match an entry in the DHCP snooping bindings database. You can
   optionally configure additional ARP packet validation.
