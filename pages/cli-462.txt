user must reauthenticate. This timer begins on initiation of the web session and is unaffected
by the activity level of the connection.

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

no ip http session hard-timeout

value.

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

ip http authentication
Use this command to specify the authentication methods for http server users. The additional
methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an error, not if it fails.
To ensure that the authentication succeeds even if all methods return an error, specify none
as the final method in the command line. For example If none specified as an authentication
method after RADIUS, no authentication is used if the RADIUS server is down.

 Format        ip http authentication <method1> [<method2> ...]
