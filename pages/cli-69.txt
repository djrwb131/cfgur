switchport protected (Interface Config)
Use this command to add an interface to a protected port group. The <groupid> parameter
identifies the set of protected ports to which this interface is assigned. You can only configure
an interface as protected in one group.

    Note: Port protection occurs within a single switch. Protected port configuration
            does not affect traffic between ports on two different switches. No traffic
            forwarding is possible between two protected ports.
