                          M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

Switch Management CPU Commands

   To manage the switch via the web GUI or telnet, an IP address needs to be assigned to the
   switch management CPU. Whereas there are CLI commands that can be used to do this,
   ezconfig simplifies the task. The tool allows you to configure the following parameters:
   1.  The administrator's user password and administrator-enable password
   2.  Management CPU IP address and network mask
   3.  System name and location information
   The tool is interactive and uses questions to guide you through the steps required to perform
   its task. At the end of the session, it will ask you if you want to save the changed information.
   To see exactly what has been changed by ezconfig at the end of the session, use the show
   running-config command.
   To perform any switch configuration other than the items listed above, use other CLI
   commands or the web GUI.

   ezconfig
   This command sets the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of the device. The IP address
   and the gateway must be on the same subnet.
