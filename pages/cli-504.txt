no radius server host

Use this command to delete the configured server entry from the list of configured RADIUS
servers. If the RADIUS authenticating server being removed is the active server in the
servers that are identified by the same server name, then the RADIUS client selects another
server for making RADIUS transactions. If you use the auth parameter, the previously
configured RADIUS authentication server is removed from the configuration. Similarly, If you
use the acct parameter, the previously configured RADIUS accounting server is removed
from the configuration. The <ipaddr> or <dnsname> parameter must match the IP address
or DSN name of the previously configured RADIUS authentication or accounting server.

 Format       no radius server host {auth | acct} {<ipaddr> | <dnsname>}

 Mode         Global Config

Command example:
(NETGEAR Switch) (Config) #radius server host acct 192.168.37.60
(NETGEAR Switch) (Config) #radius server host acct 192.168.37.60 port 1813
(NETGEAR Switch) (Config) #radius server host auth 192.168.37.60 name
Network1_RADIUS_Auth_Server port 1813
(NETGEAR Switch) (Config) #radius server host acct 192.168.37.60 name
Network2_RADIUS_Auth_Server
(NETGEAR Switch) (Config) #no radius server host acct 192.168.37.60

radius server key
Use this command to configure the key to be used in RADIUS client communication with the
specified server. Depending on whether the auth or acct keyword is used, the shared
secret is configured for the RADIUS authentication or RADIUS accounting server. The IP
address or host name provided must match a previously configured server. When this
command is executed, the secret is prompted.
Text-based configuration supports RADIUS server's secrets in encrypted and non-encrypted
format. When you save the configuration, these secret keys are stored in encrypted format
only. If you want to enter the key in encrypted format, enter the key along with the encrypted
keyword. In the output of the show running config command, these secret keys are
displayed in encrypted format. You cannot show these keys in plain text format.

    Note: The secret must be an alphanumeric value not exceeding 16 characters.
