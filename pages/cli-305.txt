     Log                Displays when you enable logging for the rule.

     Assign Queue       The queue identifier to which packets matching this rule are assigned.

     Mirror Interface   The slot/port to which packets matching this rule are copied.

     Redirect           The slot/port to which packets matching this rule are forwarded.
     Interface

     Time Range         Displays the name of the time-range if the ACL rule has referenced a time range.
     Name

     Rule Status        Status (Active/Inactive) of the ACL rule.

   show access-lists
   This command displays IP ACLs, IPv6 ACLs, and MAC access control lists information for a
   designated interface and direction.

     Format       show access-lists interface <slot/port> [in | out]

     Mode         Privileged EXEC

     Term               Definition

     ACL Type           Type of access list (IP, IPv6, or MAC).

     ACL ID             Access List name for a MAC or IPv6 access list or the numeric identifier for an IP access
                        list.

     Sequence           An optional sequence number might be specified to indicate the order of this access list
     Number             relative to other access lists already assigned to this interface and direction. A lower
                        number indicates higher precedence order. If a sequence number is already in use for
                        this interface and direction, the specified access list replaces the currently attached
                        access list using that sequence number. If the sequence number is not specified by the
                        user, a sequence number that is one greater than the highest sequence number currently
                        in use for this interface and direction is used. Valid range is (1­4,294,967,295).

IPv6 Access Control List (ACL) Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure IPv6 ACL settings. IPv6 ACLs
   ensure that only authorized users have access to specific resources and block any
   unwarranted attempts to reach network resources.
   The following rules apply to IPv6 ACLs:
   ·   The maximum number of ACLs you create is 100, regardless of type.
   ·   The system supports only Ethernet II frame types.
   ·   The maximum number of rules per IPv6 ACL is hardware-dependent.
