 Term                Definition

 Firmware Version    The firmware version of the PoE controller on the switch.

 PSE Main            Indicates the status of the PoE controller:
 Operational Status    ON--Indicates that the PoE controller is actively delivering power.
                       OFF--Indicates that the PoE controller is not delivering power.
                       FAULTY--Indicates that the PoE controller is not functioning.

 Total Power (Main   Indicates the maximum amount of power that can be delivered by this PoE unit when
 AC)                 on system power.

 Total Power (RPS)   Indicates the maximum amount of power that can be delivered by this PoE unit when
                     on RPS.

 Total Power (PD)    Indicates the maximum amount of power that can be delivered by this PoE unit when
                     on the PD source. This field is applicable only for the GSM5212P.

 Power Source        Indicates the power source being used: main AC, RPS, or PD. If PD is used as a
                     source, "PD <portNo>" is displayed.

 Threshold Power     System can power up one port, if consumed power is less than this power. That is,
                     the consumed power can be between the total power and threshold power values.
                     The threshold power value is effected by changing the system usage threshold.

 Total Power         Indicates the total amount of power being delivered to all the devices plugged into the
 Consumed            switch.

 Usage Threshold     Indicates the usage threshold level.

 Power               Indicates the management mode used by the PoE controller.
 Management Mode

 Auto Reset Mode     Indicates whether the PoE ports will be automatically reset in case of an error on a
                     port.

 Traps               Configures the traps.
