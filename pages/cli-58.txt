 Interface          Valid slot and port number separated by forward slashes. It is possible to set the
                    parameters for all ports by using the selectors on the top line.

 Port VLAN ID       The VLAN ID that this port will assign to untagged frames or priority tagged frames
                    received on this port. The value must be for an existing VLAN. The factory default is 1.

 Acceptable         The types of frames that may be received on this port. The options are 'VLAN only' and
 Frame Types        'Admit All'. When set to 'VLAN only', untagged frames or priority tagged frames received
                    on this port are discarded. When set to 'Admit All', untagged frames or priority tagged
                    frames received on this port are accepted and assigned the value of the Port VLAN ID for
                    this port. With either option, VLAN tagged frames are forwarded in accordance to the
                    802.1Q VLAN specification.

 Ingress Filtering  May be enabled or disabled. When enabled, the frame is discarded if this port is not a
                    member of the VLAN with which this frame is associated. In a tagged frame, the VLAN is
                    identified by the VLAN ID in the tag. In an untagged frame, the VLAN is the Port VLAN ID
                    specified for the port that received this frame. When disabled, all frames are forwarded in
                    accordance with the 802.1Q VLAN bridge specification. The factory default is disabled.

 GVRP               May be enabled or disabled.

 Default Priority   The 802.1p priority assigned to tagged packets arriving on the port.
