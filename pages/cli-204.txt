dos-control tcpflag
This command enables TCP Flag Denial of Service protections. If the mode is enabled,
Denial of Service prevention is active for this type of attacks. If packets ingress having TCP
Flag SYN set and a source port less than 1024 or having TCP Control Flags set to 0 and TCP
Sequence Number set to 0 or having TCP Flags FIN, URG, and PSH set and TCP Sequence
Number set to 0 or having TCP Flags SYN and FIN both set, the packets will be dropped if
the mode is enabled.

 Default       disabled

dos-control l4port
This command enables L4 Port Denial of Service protections. If the mode is enabled, Denial
of Service prevention is active for this type of attack. If packets ingress having Source
TCP/UDP Port Number equal to Destination TCP/UDP Port Number, the packets will be
dropped if the mode is enabled.

    Note: Some applications mirror source and destination L4 ports - RIP for
            example uses 520 for both. If you enable dos-control l4port,
            applications such as RIP may experience packet loss which would
            render the application inoperable.

 Default       disabled
