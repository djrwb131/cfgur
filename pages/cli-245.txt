                             M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

 Parameter            Description

 Metric Type          The metric type to advertise for redistributed routes of this type

 Subnets              Whether OSPF redistributes subnets of classful addresses, or only classful prefixes

 Dist List            A distribute list used to filter routes of this type. Only routes that pass the distribute
                      list are redistributed

 Number of Active     The number of OSPF areas with at least one interface running on this router. Also
 Areas                broken down by area type

 ABR Status           Whether the router is an area border router. A router is an area border router if it has
                      interfaces that are up in more than one area

 ASBR Status          Whether the router is an autonomous system boundary router. The router is an
                      ASBR if it is redistributing any routes or originating a default route

 RIP

 Split Horizon Mode   Whether RIP advertises routes on the interface where they were received

 Default Metric       The metric assigned to redistributed routes

 Default Route        Whether this router is originating a default route
 Advertise

 Distance             The administrative distance for RIP routes

 Redistribution       A table showing information for each source protocol (connected, static, BGP, and
                      OSPF). For each of these sources the distribution list and metric are shown. Fields
                      which are not configured are left blank. For ospf, configured ospf match parameters
                      are also shown

 Interface            The interfaces where RIP is enabled and the version sent and accepted on each
                      interface

show ip route
This command displays the routing table. The <ip-address> specifies the network for
which the route is to be displayed and displays the best matching best-route for the address.
The <mask> specifies the subnet mask for the <ip-address>. When you use the
longer-prefixes keyword, the <ip-address> and <mask> pair becomes the prefix, and
the command displays the routes to the addresses that match that prefix. Use the
<protocol> parameter to specify the protocol that installed the routes. The value for
<protocol> can be connected, ospf, rip, or static. Use the all parameter to display
all routes including best and non-best routes. If you do not use the all parameter, the
command only displays the best route.
A "T" flag appended to a route indicates that it is an ECMP route, but only one of its next hops
has been installed in the forwarding table. The forwarding table might limit the number of
ECMP routes or the number of ECMP groups. When an ECMP route cannot be installed
because such a limit is reached, the route is installed with a single next hop. Such truncated
routes can be identified by a "T" after the interface name.
