You can use the copy command with the following options:
copy {<url> | image1 | image2 | nvram:backup-config | nvram:clibanner |
nvram:cpu-pkt-capture.pcap | nvram:errorlog | nvram:factory-defaults | nvram:log |
nvram:script | nvram:startup-config | nvram:tech-support | nvram:traplog |
system:running-config} {<url> | isa-users | image1 | image2 | nvram:startup-config |
nvram:backup-config | nvram:startup-config | nvram:clibanner | nvram:script
<destfilename> | nvram:script <destfilename> noval | nvram:sshkey-dsa |
nvram:sshkey-rsa1 | nvram:sshkey-rsa2 | nvram:sslpem-dhweak | nvram:sslpem-dhstrong |
nvram:sslpem-root | nvram:sslpem-server:nvram:startup-config}

Use the ias-users keyword to download the IAS user database file. When the IAS user's
file is downloaded, the switch IAS user's database is replaced with the users and their
attributes in the downloaded file.
In the copy <url> ias-users command, for <url>, use one of the following values for the
IAS user's file:
{{tftp://<ipaddr> | <ipv6address> | <hostname>/<filepath>/<filename>} |
{sftp | scp://<username>@<ipaddress>/<filepath>/<filename>}}

    Note: The maximum length for the file path is 160 characters, and the
          maximum length for the file name is 31 characters.

For TFTP, SFTP, and SCP, the <ipaddr> or <hostname> parameter is the IP address or
host name of the server, <filepath> is the path to the file, and <filename> is the name
of the file that you want to upload or download. For SFTP and SCP, the <username>
parameter is the user name for logging into the remote server via SSH.

    Note: <ip6address> is also a valid parameter for routing packages that
          support IPv6.

For switches that support a USB device, the copy command can be used to transfer files from
and to the USB device. The syntax for the USB file is: usb://<filename>. The USB device
can be either a source or destination in the copy command. It cannot be used as both source
and destination in a copy command.

          CAUTION:

          Before you load a new release image to make a backup, upload the
          existing startup-config.cfg file to the server.
