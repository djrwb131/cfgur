SNMP Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) on the switch. You can configure the switch to act as an SNMP agent so
   that it can communicate with SNMP managers on your network.

   snmp-server
   Use this command to set the name and the physical location of the switch and the
   organization responsible for the network. The range for <name>, <loc> and <con> is from 1
   to 31 alphanumeric characters.

     Default       none

     Format        snmp-server {sysname <name> | location <loc> | contact <con>}

     Mode          Global Config

   snmp-server community
   Use this command to add (and name) a new SNMP community. A community <name> is a
   name associated with the switch and with a set of SNMP managers that manage it with a
   specified privileged level. The length of <name> can be up to 16 case-sensitive characters.

       Note: Community names in the SNMP community table must be unique.
                When making multiple entries using the same community name, the
                first entry is kept and processed and all duplicate entries are ignored.

     Default       · Public and private, which you can rename.
                   · Default values for the remaining four community names are blank.

     Format        snmp-server community <name>

     Mode          Global Config
