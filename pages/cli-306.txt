ipv6 access-list
This command creates an IPv6 access control list (ACL) identified by <name>, consisting of
classification fields defined for the IP header of an IPv6 frame. The <name> parameter is a
case-sensitive alphanumeric string from 1 to 31 characters uniquely identifying the IPv6
access list.
If an IPv6 ACL by this name exists, this command enters IPv6-Access-List config mode to
allow updating the existing IPv6 ACL.

    Note: The CLI mode changes to IPv6-Access-List Config mode when you
             successfully execute this command.

ipv6 access-list rename
This command changes the name of an IPv6 ACL. The <name> parameter is the name of an
existing IPv6 ACL. The <newname> parameter is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string from 1
to 31 characters uniquely identifying the IPv6 access list.

{deny | permit} (IPv6)
This command creates a new rule for the current IPv6 access list. Each rule is appended to
the list of configured rules for the list.

    Note: The no form of this command is not supported because the rules
             within an IPv6 ACL cannot be deleted individually. Rather, the entire
             IPv6 ACL must be deleted and respecified.
