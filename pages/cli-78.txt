     Term             Definition

     LeaveAll Timer   This Leave All Time controls how frequently LeaveAll PDUs are generated. A LeaveAll
                      PDU indicates that all registrations will shortly be deregistered. Participants will need to
                      rejoin in order to maintain registration. There is an instance of this timer on a per-Port,
                      per-GARP participant basis. The Leave All Period Timer is set to a random value in the
                      range of LeaveAllTime to 1.5*LeaveAllTime. Permissible values are 200­6000
                      centiseconds (2­60 seconds). The factory default is 1000 centiseconds (10 seconds).

     Port GVMRP       The GVRP administrative mode for the port, which is enabled or disabled (default). If this
     Mode             parameter is disabled, Join Time, Leave Time, and Leave All Time have no effect.

GMRP Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure and view GARP Multicast
   Registration Protocol (GMRP) information. Like IGMP snooping, GMRP helps control the
   flooding of multicast packets. GMRP-enabled switches dynamically register and deregister
   group membership information with the MAC networking devices attached to the same
   segment. GMRP also allows group membership information to propagate across all
   networking devices in the bridged LAN that support Extended Filtering Services.

       Note: If GMRP is disabled, the system does not forward GMRP messages.

   set gmrp adminmode
   This command enables GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP) on the system.

     Default        disabled

     Format         set gmrp adminmode

     Mode           Privileged EXEC

   no set gmrp adminmode

   This command disables GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP) on the system.

     Format         no set gmrp adminmode

     Mode           Privileged EXEC

   set gmrp interfacemode
   This command enables GARP Multicast Registration Protocol on a single interface (Interface
   Config mode) or all interfaces (Global Config mode). If an interface which has GARP enabled
   is enabled for routing or is enlisted as a member of a port-channel (LAG), GARP functionality
   is disabled on that interface. GARP functionality is subsequently re-enabled if routing is
