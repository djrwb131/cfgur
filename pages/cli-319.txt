poe detection
Use this command to configure the detection type on a global basis or per interface. It is used
to configure which types of PDs will be detected and powered by the switch. There are three
options:
   ieee. Detect resistive-type devices (IEEE standard)
   pre-ieee. Legacy capacitive detection only (nonstandard)
   auto. Perform resistive detection first (IEEE standard) and capacitive detection
    (pre-IEEE standard)

 Default       auto

 Format        poe detection {ieee | pre-ieee | auto}

 Mode           Global Config
                Interface Config

no poe detection

Use this command to set the detection mode to the default on a global basis or per interface.

 Format        no poe detection

 Mode           Global Config
                Interface Config

poe high-power
Use this command to switch a port from 802.3af mode to high-power mode. This mode is
used to power up devices that require more power than the current IEEE 802.3af power
(more than 12.95 watts at the PD). There are three options:
   legacy. Use this mode if the device can power up (more than 12.95 watts) with higher
    current and it cannot identify itself as a Class 4 device.
   pre-dot3at. Use this mode if the device cannot identify itself as a Class 4 device and it
    does not have LLDP support.
   dot3at. Use this mode if the device is a Class 4 device capable of figuring out power
    requirements through 2-event classification or LLDP.

 Default       dot3at

 Format        poe high-power {legacy | pre-dot3at | dot3at}

 Mode          Interface Config
