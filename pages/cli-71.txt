                        M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

Three types of port designations exist within a private VLAN:
·   Promiscuous Ports--An endpoint connected to a promiscuous port is allowed to
    communicate with any endpoint within the private VLAN. Multiple promiscuous ports can
    be defined for a single private VLAN domain.
·   Isolated Ports--An endpoint connected to an isolated port is allowed to communicate
    with endpoints connected to promiscuous ports only. Endpoints connected to adjacent
    isolated ports cannot communicate with each other.
·   Community Ports--An endpoint connected to a community port is allowed to
    communicate with the endpoints within a community and with any configured
    promiscuous port. The endpoints that belong to one community cannot communicate with
    endpoints that belong to a different community or with endpoints connected to isolated
    ports.
The Private VLANs can be extended across multiple switches through inter-switch/stack links
that transport primary, community, and isolated VLANs between devices.

switchport private-vlan
This command is used to define a private-VLAN association for an isolated or community
port or a mapping for a promiscuous port.

 Format        switchport private-vlan {host-association <primary-vlan-id>
               <secondary-vlan-id> | mapping <primary-vlan-id> {add | remove}
               <secondary-vlan-list>}

 Mode          Interface Config

 Parameter               Definition

 host-association        Defines VLAN association for community or host ports.

 <primary-vlan-id>       Primary VLAN ID of a private VLAN.

 secondary-vlan-id       Secondary (isolated or community) VLAN ID of a private VLAN.

 mapping                 Defines the private VLAN mapping for promiscuous ports.

 add                     Associates the secondary VLAN with the primary one.

 remove                  Deletes the secondary VLANs from the primary VLAN association.

 <secondary-vlan-list>   A list of secondary VLANs to be mapped to a primary VLAN.

no switchport private-vlan

This command is used to remove the private-VLAN association or mapping from the port.

 Format        no switchport private-vlan {host-association | mapping}

 Mode          Interface Config
