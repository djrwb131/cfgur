User Account Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to add, manage, and delete system users.
   The software has two default users: admin and guest. The admin user can view and
   configure system settings, and the guest user can view settings.

           Note: You cannot delete the admin user. There is only one user allowed with
               read/write privileges. You can configure up to five read-only users on
               the system.

   username (Global Config)
   Use this command to add a new user to the local user database. The default privilege level
   is 1. Using the encrypted keyword allows the administrator to transfer local user passwords
   between devices without having to know the passwords. When the password parameter is
   used along with encrypted parameter, the password must be exactly 128 hexadecimal
   characters in length. If the password strength feature is enabled, this command checks for
   password strength and returns an appropriate error if it fails to meet the password strength
   criteria. The optional override-complexity-check parameter disables the validation of
   the password strength.

     Format        username <name> {password <password> [encrypted
                   [override-complexity-check] | level <level> [encrypted
                   [override-complexity-check]] | override-complexity-check]} | {level
                   <level> [override-complexity-check] password}
