DNS Client Commands

   These commands are used in the Domain Name System (DNS), an Internet directory
   service. DNS is how domain names are translated into IP addresses. When enabled, the
   DNS client provides a hostname lookup service to other components.

   ip domain lookup
   Use this command to enable the DNS client.

     Default        enabled

     Format         ip domain lookup

     Mode           Global Config

   no ip domain lookup

   Use this command to disable the DNS client.

     Format         no ip domain lookup

     Mode           Global Config

   ip domain name
   Use this command to define a default domain name that the software uses to complete
   unqualified host names (names with a domain name). By default, no default domain name is
   configured in the system. <name> may not be longer than 255 characters and should not
   include an initial period. This <name> should be used only when the default domain name
   list, configured using the ip domain list command, is empty.

     Default        none

     Format         ip domain name <name>

     Mode           Global Config

    Command example:
   The CLI command ip domain name yahoo.com configures yahoo.com as a default
   domain name. For an unqualified hostname xxx, a DNS query is made to find the IP address
   corresponding to xxx.yahoo.com.
