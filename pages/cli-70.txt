Private VLAN Commands

   The Private VLANs feature separates a regular VLAN domain into two or more subdomains.
   Each subdomain is defined (represented) by a primary VLAN and a secondary VLAN. The
   primary VLAN ID is the same for all subdomains that belong to a private VLAN. The
   secondary VLAN ID differentiates subdomains from each other and provides Layer 2 isolation
   between ports of the same private VLAN. The types of VLANs within a private VLAN are as
   follows:
      Primary VLAN--Forwards the traffic from the promiscuous ports to isolated ports,
       community ports, and other promiscuous ports in the same private VLAN. Only one
       primary VLAN can be configured per private VLAN. All ports within a private VLAN share
       primary VLAN.
      Isolated VLAN--A secondary VLAN that carries traffic from isolated ports to promiscuous
       ports. Only one isolated VLAN can be configured per private VLAN.
      Community VLAN--A secondary VLAN that forwards traffic between ports that belong to
       the same community and the promiscuous ports. There can be multiple community
       VLANs per private VLAN.
