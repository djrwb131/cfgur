mark ip-precedence
This command marks all packets for the associated traffic stream with the specified IP
Precedence value. The IP Precedence value is an integer from 0 to 7.

    Note: This command might not be used on IPv6 classes. IPv6 does not
             have a precedence field.

 Policy Type       In

police-simple
This command is used to establish the traffic policing style for the specified class. The simple
form of the police command uses a single data rate and burst size, resulting in two outcomes:
conform and violate. The conforming data rate is specified in kilobits-per-second (Kbps) and
is an integer from 1 to 4294967295. The conforming burst size is specified in kilobytes (KB)
and is an integer from 1 to 128.
For each outcome, the only possible actions are drop, set-cos-transmit, set-dscp-transmit,
set-prec-transmit, or transmit. In this simple form of the police command, the conform action
defaults to transmit and the violate action defaults to drop.
For set-cos-transmit, an 802.1p priority value is required and is specified as an integer
from 0-7.
For set-dscp-transmit, a <dscpval> value is required and is specified as either an
integer from 0 to 63, or symbolically through one of the following keywords: af11, af12,
af13, af21, af22, af23, af31, af32, af33, af41, af42, af43, be, cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3,
cs4, cs5, cs6, cs7, or ef.
For set-prec-transmit, an IP Precedence value is required and is specified as an
integer from 0-7.
For set-cos-transmit, an 802.1p priority value is required and is specified as an integer
from 0-7.
