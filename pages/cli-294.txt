mac access-list extended rename
This command changes the name of a MAC access control list (ACL). The <name>
parameter is the name of an existing MAC ACL. The <newname> parameter is a
case-sensitive alphanumeric string from 1 to 31 characters uniquely identifying the MAC
access list.
This command fails if a MAC ACL by the name <newname> exists.

{deny | permit} (MAC ACL)
This command creates a new rule for the current MAC access list. Each rule is appended to
the list of configured rules for the list.

    Note: The no form of this command is not supported, since the rules within a
             MAC ACL cannot be deleted individually. Rather, the entire MAC ACL
             must be deleted and respecified.

    Note: An implicit deny all MAC rule always terminates the access list.

A rule might either deny or permit traffic according to the specified classification fields. At a
minimum, the source and destination MAC value must be specified, each of which might be
substituted using the keyword any to indicate a match on any value in that field. The
remaining command parameters are all optional, but the most frequently used parameters
appear in the same relative order as shown in the command format.
The Ethertype might be specified as either a keyword or a four-digit hexadecimal value from
0x0600-0xFFFF. The currently supported <ethertypekey> values are: appletalk, arp,
