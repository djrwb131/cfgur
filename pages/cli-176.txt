set mld querier election participate
Use this command to enable the Snooping Querier to participate in the Querier Election
process when it discovers the presence of another Querier in the VLAN. When this mode is

than the Snooping Querier's address, it stops sending periodic queries. If the Snooping
Querier wins the election, then it will continue sending periodic queries.
