     LeaveAll Timer   This Leave All Time controls how frequently LeaveAll PDUs are generated. A LeaveAll
                      PDU indicates that all registrations will shortly be deregistered. Participants will need to
                      rejoin in order to maintain registration. There is an instance of this timer on a per-Port,
                      per-GARP participant basis. The Leave All Period Timer is set to a random value in the
                      range of LeaveAllTime to 1.5*LeaveAllTime. Permissible values are 200­6000
                      centiseconds (2­60 seconds). The factory default is 1000 centiseconds (10 seconds).

     Port GMRP        The GMRP administrative mode for the port. It may be enabled or disabled. If this
     Mode             parameter is disabled, Join Time, Leave Time, and Leave All Time have no effect.
