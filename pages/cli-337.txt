show interface ethernet
This command displays detailed statistics for a specific interface or for all CPU traffic based
upon the argument.

 Format       show interface ethernet {<slot/port> | switchport}

 Mode         Privileged EXEC

When you specify a value for <slot/port>, the command output displays the information
that is shown in the following table.

 Term              Definition

 Packets Received  · Total Packets Received (Octets) - The total number of octets of data (including those in
                     bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including Frame Check
                     Sequence (FCS) octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of Ethernet
                     utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects
                     should be sampled before and after a common interval. The result of this equation is the
                     value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the Ethernet segment on a scale of
                     0­100 percent.
                   · Packets Received 64 Octets - The total number of packets (including bad packets)
                     received that were 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).
                   · Packets Received 65­127 Octets - The total number of packets (including bad packets)
                     received that were from 65 through 127 octets in length inclusive (excluding framing bits
                     but including FCS octets).
                   · Packets Received 128­255 Octets - The total number of packets (including bad packets)
                     received that were from 128 through 255 octets in length inclusive (excluding framing bits
                     but including FCS octets).
                   · Packets Received 256­511 Octets - The total number of packets (including bad packets)
                     received that were from 256 through 511 octets in length inclusive (excluding framing bits
                     but including FCS octets).
