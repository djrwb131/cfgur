 Queue Id           An interface supports n queues numbered 0 to (n-1). The specific n value is
                    platform-dependent.

 Minimum            The minimum transmission bandwidth guarantee for the queue, expressed as a
 Bandwidth          percentage. A value of 0 means bandwidth is not guaranteed and the queue operates
                    using best-effort. This is a configured value.

 Scheduler Type     Indicates whether this queue is scheduled for transmission using a strict priority or a
                    weighted scheme. This is a configured value.

 Queue              The queue depth management technique used for this queue (tail drop).
