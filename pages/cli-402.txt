show capture packets
Use this command to display packets captured and saved to RAM. It is possible to capture
and save into RAM, packets that are received or transmitted through the CPU. A maximum
128 packets can be saved into RAM per capturing session. A maximum 128 bytes per packet
can be saved into the RAM. If a packet holds more than 128 bytes, only the first 128 bytes
are saved; data more than 128 bytes is skipped and cannot be displayed in the CLI.
Capturing packets is stopped automatically when 128 packets are captured and have not yet
been displayed during a capture session. Captured packets are not retained after a reload
cycle.
