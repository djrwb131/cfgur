show snmpcommunity
Use this command to display SNMP community information. Six communities are supported.
You can add, change, or delete communities. The switch does not need to be reset for
changes to take effect.
The SNMP agent of the switch complies with SNMP versions 1, 2 or 3. For more information
about the SNMP specification, see the SNMP RFCs. The SNMP agent sends traps through
TCP/IP to an external SNMP manager based on the SNMP configuration (the trap receiver
and other SNMP community parameters).

 Format         show snmpcommunity

 Mode           Privileged EXEC

 Field             Definition

 SNMP              The community string to which this entry grants access. A valid entry is a case-sensitive
 Community         alphanumeric string of up to 16 characters. Each row of this table must contain a unique
 Name              community name.

 Client IP         An IP address (or portion thereof) from which this device will accept SNMP packets with
 Address           the associated community. The requesting entity's IP address is ANDed with the Subnet
                   Mask before being compared to the IP address. Note: If the Subnet Mask is set to
                   0.0.0.0, an IP address of 0.0.0.0 matches all IP addresses. The default value is 0.0.0.0.

 Client IP Mask    A mask to be ANDed with the requesting entity's IP address before comparison with IP
                   address. If the result matches with IP address then the address is an authenticated IP
                   address. For example, if the IP address = 9.47.128.0 and the corresponding Subnet
                   Mask = 255.255.255.0 a range of incoming IP addresses would match, i.e. the incoming
                   IP address could equal 9.47.128.0 - 9.47.128.255. The default value is 0.0.0.0.

 Access Mode       The access level for this community string.

 Status            The status of this community access entry.

show snmptrap
Use this command to display SNMP trap receivers. Trap messages are sent across a
network to an SNMP network manager. These messages alert the manager to events
occurring within the switch or on the network. Six trap receivers are simultaneously
supported.
