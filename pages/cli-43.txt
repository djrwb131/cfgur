 Loop               The current loop inconsistent state of this port in this MST instance. When in loop
 Inconsistent       inconsistent state, the port has failed to receive BPDUs while configured with loop guard
 State              enabled. Loop inconsistent state maintains the port in a "blocking" state until a
                    subsequent BPDU is received.

 Transitions Into   The number of times this interface has transitioned into loop inconsistent state.

show spanning-tree mst port summary
This command displays the settings of one or all ports within the specified multiple spanning
tree instance. The parameter <mstid> indicates a particular MST instance. The parameter
{<slot/port> | all} indicates the desired switch port or all ports.
If you specify 0 (defined as the default CIST ID) as the <mstid>, the status summary
displays for one or all ports within the Common and Internal Spanning Tree.

 Format          show spanning-tree mst port summary <mstid> {<slot/port> | all}
