set igmp groupmembership-interval
This command sets the IGMP Group Membership Interval time on a VLAN, one interface, or
all interfaces. The Group Membership Interval time is the amount of time in seconds that a
switch waits for a report from a particular group on a particular interface before deleting the
interface from the entry. This value must be greater than the IGMPv3 Maximum Response
time value. The range is 2­3600 seconds.

particular group in that interface. This value must be less than the IGMP Query Interval time
value. The range is 1­25 seconds.
