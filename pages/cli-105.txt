and disables unicast storm recovery.

 Format      no storm-control unicast rate

 Mode        Interface Config

storm-control unicast (Global Config)
This command enables unicast storm recovery mode for all interfaces. If the mode is
enabled, unicast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of unknown L2 unicast (destination
lookup failure) traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold,
the traffic will be dropped. Therefore, the rate of unknown unicast traffic will be limited to the
configured threshold.

 Default     disabled

 Format      storm-control unicast

 Mode        Global Config

no storm-control unicast

storm-control unicast level (Global Config)
This command configures the unicast storm recovery threshold for all interfaces as a
percentage of link speed, and enables unicast storm recovery. If the mode is enabled, unicast
storm recovery is active, and if the rate of unknown L2 unicast (destination lookup failure)
traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic will be
dropped. Therefore, the rate of unknown unicast traffic will be limited to the configured
threshold.

 Default     5

 Format      storm-control unicast level <0-100>

 Mode        Global Config
