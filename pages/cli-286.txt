DiffServ Service Commands

   Use the DiffServ service commands to assign a DiffServ traffic conditioning policy, which you
   specified by using the policy commands, to an interface in the incoming direction
   The service commands attach a defined policy to a directional interface. You can assign only
   one policy at any one time to an interface in the inbound direction. DiffServ is not used in the
   outbound direction.
   This set of commands consists of service addition/removal.
   The CLI command root is service-policy.

   service-policy
   This command attaches a policy to an interface in the inbound direction. The <policyname>
   parameter is the name of an existing DiffServ policy. This command causes a service to
   create a reference to the policy.

       Note: This command effectively enables DiffServ on an interface in the
               inbound direction. There is no separate interface administrative
               'mode' command for DiffServ.
