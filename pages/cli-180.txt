port-security mac-address sticky
This command enables sticky mode Port MAC Locking on a port. If accompanied by a MAC
address and a VLAN id (for interface config mode only), it adds a sticky MAC address to the
list of statically locked MAC addresses. These sticky addresses are converted back to
dynamically locked addresses if sticky mode is disabled on the port. The <vid> is the VLAN
ID. The Global command applies the sticky mode to all valid interfaces (physical and LAG).
There is no global sticky mode as such.
Sticky addresses that are dynamically learned display in the output of the show running
config command as port-security mac-address sticky <mac> <vid> entries.
This distinguishes them from static entries.

 Format       port-security mac-address sticky [<mac-address> <vid>]
