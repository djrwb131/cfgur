 Mode         Interface Config

 Parameter            Description

 auto                 The port is in the Unauthorized state until it presents its user name and
                      password credentials to an authenticator. If the authenticator authorizes the
                      port, then it is placed in the Authorized state.

 force-authorized     Sets the authorization state of the port to Authorized, bypassing the
                      authentication process.

 force- unauthorized  Sets the authorization state of the port to Unauthorized, bypassing the
                      authentication process.
