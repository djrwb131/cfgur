rmon hcalarm
This command sets the RMON hcalarm entry in the High Capacity RMON alarm MIN group.

 Format      rmon hcalarm <alarm-number> <variable> <sample-interval>
             <sampling-type> {rising-threshold high <value>} {rising-threshold
             low <value>} {falling-threshold high <value>} {falling-threshold low
             <value>} [startup {rising | falling | rising-falling}] [owner
             <string>]

 Mode        Global Config

 Parameter                     Description

 <alarm-number>                The identifier of the hcalarm instance.

 <variable>                    The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only
                               variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of integer.

 <sample-interval>             The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and
                               compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The range is 1to
                               2147483647.

 <sampling-type>larm Sample    The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the
 Type                          value to be compared against thresholds. Possible types are
                               Absolute or Delta.

 rising-threshold high         High capacity alarm rising threshold absolute value high. The upper
 <value>                       32 bits of the absolute value for threshold for the sampled statistics.

 rising-threshold low          High capacity alarm rising threshold absolute value low. The lower
 <value>                       32 bits of the absolute value for threshold for the sampled statistics.

 falling-threshold high        High capacity alarm falling threshold absolute value high. The upper
 <value>                       32 bits of the absolute value for threshold for the sampled statistic.

 falling-threshold low         High capacity alarm falling threshold absolute value high. The upper
 <value>                       32 bits of the absolute value for threshold for the sampled statistic.

 [startup {rising | falling |  High capacity alarm startup alarm that may be sent. Possible values
 rising-falling}]              are Rising Alarm, Falling Alarm or both.

 [owner <string>]              High capacity alarm owner. The owner string associated with the
                               entry.

no rmon hcalarm

This command deletes the RMON hcalarm entry.

 Format      no rmon hcalarm <alarm number>
