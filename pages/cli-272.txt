DiffServ Class Commands

   Use the DiffServ class commands to define traffic classification. To classify traffic, you specify
   Behavior Aggregate (BA), based on DSCP and Multi-Field (MF) classes of traffic (name,
   match criteria)
   This set of commands consists of class creation/deletion and matching, with the class match
   commands specifying Layer 3, Layer 2, and general match criteria. The class match criteria
   are also known as class rules, with a class definition consisting of one or more rules to
   identify the traffic that belongs to the class.

       Note: Once you create a class match criterion for a class, you cannot
               change or delete the criterion. To change or delete a class match
               criterion, you must delete and re-create the entire class.

   The CLI command root is class-map.

   class-map
   This command defines a DiffServ class of type match-all. When used without any match
   condition, this command enters the class-map mode. The <class-map-name> is a
   case-sensitive alphanumeric string from 1 to 31 characters uniquely identifying an existing
   DiffServ class.

       Note: The class-map-name "default" is reserved and you must not use it.

   The class type of match-all indicates all of the individual match conditions must be true for
   a packet to be considered a member of the class. This command might be used without
   specifying a class type to enter the Class-Map Config mode for an existing DiffServ class.
