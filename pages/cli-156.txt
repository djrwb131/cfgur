set igmp fast-leave
This command enables or disables IGMP Snooping fast-leave admin mode on a selected
interface or VLAN. Enabling fast-leave allows the switch to immediately remove the layer 2
LAN interface from its forwarding table entry upon receiving an IGMP leave message for that
multicast group without first sending out MAC-based general queries to the interface.
You should enable fast-leave admin mode only on VLANs where only one host is connected
to each layer 2 LAN port. This prevents the inadvertent dropping of the other hosts that were
connected to the same layer 2 LAN port but were still interested in receiving multicast traffic
directed to that group. Also, fast-leave processing is supported only with IGMP version 2
hosts.
