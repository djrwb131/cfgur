About MVR

   Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) Layer 3 is widely used for IPv4 network
   multicasting. In Layer 2 networks, IGMP uses resources inefficiently. For example, a Layer 2
   switch sends multicast frames to all ports, even if there are receivers connected to only a few
   ports.
   To address this problem, the IGMP Snooping protocol was developed. The problem still
   appears, though, when receivers are in different VLANs.
   Multicast VLAN registration (MVR) is intended to solve the problem of receivers in different
   VLANs. It uses a dedicated manually configured VLAN, called the multicast VLAN, to forward
   multicast traffic over a Layer 2 network with IGMP snooping.

MVR Commands

   mvr
   This command enables MVR.

     Default  Disabled

     Format   mvr

     Mode     Global Config
              Interface Config

   no mvr

   This command disables MVR.

     Format   no mvr

     Mode     Global Config
              Interface Config

   mvr group
   This command adds an MVR membership group. <A.B.C.D> is the IP multicast group being
   added.
   The count is the number of incremental multicast groups being added (the first multicast
   group is A.B.C.D). If a count is not specified, only one multicast group is added.

     Format   mvr group <A.B.C.D> [count]

     Mode     Global Config
