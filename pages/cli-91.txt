Term               Definition

Transmit Period    The timer used by the authenticator state machine on the specified port to determine
                   when to send an EAPOL EAP Request/Identity frame to the supplicant. The value is
                   expressed in seconds and will be in the range of 1 and 65535.

Guest-VLAN ID      The guest VLAN identifier configured on the interface.

Guest VLAN         The time in seconds for which the authenticator waits before authorizing and placing the
Period             port in the Guest VLAN, if no EAPOL packets are detected on that port.

Supplicant         The timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port to timeout the supplicant.
Timeout            The value is expressed in seconds and will be in the range of 1 and 65535.

Server Timeout     The timer used by the authenticator on this port to timeout the authentication server.
                   The value is expressed in seconds and will be in the range of 1 and 65535.

Maximum            The maximum number of times the authenticator state machine on this port will
Requests           retransmit an EAPOL EAP Request/Identity before timing out the supplicant. The value
                   will be in the range of 1 and 10.

VLAN Id            The VLAN assigned to the port by the radius server. This is only valid when the port
                   control mode is not Mac-based.

VLAN Assigned      The reason the VLAN identified in the VLAN Idfield has been assigned to the port.
Reason             Possible values are RADIUS, Unauthenticated VLAN, Guest VLAN, default, and Not
                   Assigned. When the VLAN Assigned Reason is `Not Assigned', it means that the port
                   has not been assigned to any VLAN by dot1x. This only valid when the port control
                   mode is not MAC-based.

Reauthentication   The timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port to determine when
Period             reauthentication of the supplicant takes place. The value is expressed in seconds and
                   will be in the range of 1 and 65535.

Reauthentication   Indicates if reauthentication is enabled on this port. Possible values are `True" or
Enabled            "False".

Key Transmission   Indicates if the key is transmitted to the supplicant for the specified port. Possible values
Enabled            are True or False.

Control Direction  The control direction for the specified port or ports. Possible values are both or in.

Maximum Users      The maximum number of clients that can get authenticated on the port in the
                   MAC-based dot1x authentication mode. This value is used only when the port control
                   mode is not MAC-based.

Unauthenticated    Indicates the unauthenticated VLAN configured for this port. This value is valid for the
VLAN ID            port only when the port control mode is not MAC-based.

Session Timeout    Indicates the time for which the session is valid. The time period in seconds is returned
                   by the RADIUS server on authentication of the port. This value is valid for the port only
                   when the port control mode is not MAC-based.

Session            This value indicates the action to be taken once the session timeout expires. Possible
Termination        values are Default, Radius-Request. If the value is Default, the session is terminated
Action             the port goes into unauthorized state. If the value is Radius-Request, a reauthentication
                   of the client authenticated on the port is performed. This value is valid for the port only
                   when the port control mode is not MAC-based.
