ip http secure-session hard-timeout
Use this command to configure the hard time-out for secure HTTP sessions in hours. When
the time-out expires, the user must reauthenticate. This timer begins on initiation of the web
session and is unaffected by the activity level of the connection. The secure session hard
time-out cannot be set to zero (infinite).

 Default       24

 Format        ip http secure-session hard-timeout <1-168>

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

no ip http secure-session hard-timeout

Use this command to reset the hard time-out for secure HTTP sessions to the default value.

 Format        no ip http secure-session hard-timeout

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

ip https authentication
Use this command to specify the authentication methods for http server users. The additional
methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an error, not if it fails.
To ensure that the authentication succeeds even if all methods return an error, specify none
as the final method in the command line. If none is specified as an authentication method
after radius, no authentication is used if the RADIUS server is down.

 Format        ip https authentication <method1> [<method2> ...]

 Mode          Global Config

 Term             Definition
