If you enter the optional <vlanid> parameter, the command output also displays detailed
information, including interface information, for a specific VLAN. The ID is a valid VLAN
identification number.

 Term             Definition

 Interface        Valid slot and port number separated by forward slashes. It is possible to set the
                  parameters for all ports by using the selectors on the top line.

 Current          The degree of participation of this port in this VLAN. The permissible values are:
                   Include - This port is always a member of this VLAN. This is equivalent to
                    registration fixed in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.
                   Exclude - This port is never a member of this VLAN. This is equivalent to
                    registration forbidden in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.
                   Autodetect - To allow the port to be dynamically registered in this VLAN via GVRP.
                    The port will not participate in this VLAN unless a join request is received on this
                    port. This is equivalent to registration normal in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.

 Configured       The configured degree of participation of this port in this VLAN. The permissible values
                  are:
                   Include - This port is always a member of this VLAN. This is equivalent to
                    registration fixed in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.
                   Exclude - This port is never a member of this VLAN. This is equivalent to
                    registration forbidden in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.
                   Autodetect - To allow the port to be dynamically registered in this VLAN via GVRP.
                    The port will not participate in this VLAN unless a join request is received on this
                    port. This is equivalent to registration normal in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.

 Tagging          The tagging behavior for this port in this VLAN.
                   Tagged - Transmit traffic for this VLAN as tagged frames.
                   Untagged - Transmit traffic for this VLAN as untagged frames.
