                             M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

 Parameter                     Description
 eq {<portkey> | <0-65535>}    Note: This option is available only if the protocol is tcp or udp.
                               When eq is specified, an IP ACL rule matches only if the Layer 4
                               port number is equal to the specified port number or port key.
                               You can enter the port number, which ranges from 0-65535, or the
                               port key, which can be one of the following keywords:
                               For tcp protocol: bgp, domain, echo, ftp, ftp-data, http, smtp,
                               telnet, www, pop2, or pop3.
                               For udp protocol: domain, echo, ntp, rip, snmp, tftp, time, or
                               who.
                               Each of these keywords translates into its equivalent port number.

                               Note: Port number matches-only apply to unfragmented or first
                               fragments.

                               Note: You can specify a port key or port number for the source and
                               a port key or port number for the destination.

 <dstip> <dstmask>             Specifies a destination IP address and netmask for match condition
                               of the IP ACL rule.

 [precedence <precedence> |    Specifies the ToS for an IP ACL rule depending on a match of
 tos <tos> [<tosmask>] | dscp  precedence or DSCP values using the parameters precedence
 <dscp>]                       <precedence>, tos <tos>, or dscp <dscp>.
                               <tosmask> is an optional parameter.

 [log]                         Specifies that this rule is to be logged.

 [rate-limit <1-4294967295>    You can specify a simple rate limiter for packets matching an ACL
 <1-128>]                      permit rule. You must specify the allowed rate of traffic in kbps
                               (from 1-429496729) and burst size in kbytes (from 1-128). The
                               conforming traffic is allowed to transmit and nonconforming traffic is
                               dropped. This action is ignored for any deny rule, because, by
                               definition, matching packets are dropped.

 [assign-queue <queue-id>]     Specifies the assign-queue, which is the queue identifier to which
                               packets matching this rule are assigned.

 [{mirror | redirect}          Specifies the mirror or redirect interface, which is the <slot/port>
 <slot/port>]                  to which packets matching this rule are copied or forwarded,
                               respectively.

no access-list

This command deletes an IP ACL that is identified by the parameter <accesslistnumber>
from the system. The range for <accesslistnumber> 1-99 for standard access lists and
100-199 for extended access lists.

 Format       no access-list <accesslistnumber>
