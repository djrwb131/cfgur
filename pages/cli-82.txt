dot1x initialize
This command begins the initialization sequence on the specified port. This command is only
valid if the control mode for the specified port is "auto" or "mac-based". If the control mode is
not "auto" or "mac-based," an error is returned.

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

dot1x mac-auth-bypass
This command enables MAC-Based Authentication Bypass (MAB) for 802.1x-unaware
clients. MAB provides 802.1x-unaware clients controlled access to the network using the
devices' MAC address as an identifier. This requires that the known and allowable MAC
address and corresponding access rights be pre-populated in the authentication server. MAB
works only when the port control mode of the port is MAC-based.

 Format        dot1x mac-auth-bypass
