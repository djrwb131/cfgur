sflow poller
A data source configured to collect counter samples is called a poller. Use this command to
enable a new sFlow poller instance for this data source if <rcvr-idx> is valid.

 Format         sflow poller {<rcvr-indx> | interval <poll-interval>}

 Mode           Interface Config

 Field          Description

 Receiver Index Enter the sFlow Receiver associated with the sampler/poller. A value of zero (0) means
                that no receiver is configured. The range is 1-8. The default is 0.

 Poll Interval  Enter the sFlow instance polling interval. A poll interval of zero (0) disables counter
                sampling. When set to zero (0), all the poller parameters are set to their corresponding
                default value. The range is 0-86400. The default is 0. A value of N means once in N
                seconds a counter sample is generated.
