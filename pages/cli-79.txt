disabled and port-channel (LAG) membership is removed from an interface that has GARP
enabled.

no set gmrp interfacemode

This command disables GARP Multicast Registration Protocol on a single interface or all
interfaces. If an interface which has GARP enabled is enabled for routing or is enlisted as a
member of a port-channel (LAG), GARP functionality is disabled. GARP functionality is
subsequently re-enabled if routing is disabled and port-channel (LAG) membership is
removed from an interface that has GARP enabled.

 Term              Definition

 Interface         The slot/port of the interface that this row in the table describes.

 Join Timer        The interval between the transmission of GARP PDUs registering (or re-registering)
                   membership for an attribute. Current attributes are a VLAN or multicast group. There is
                   an instance of this timer on a per-Port, per-GARP participant basis. Permissible values
                   are 10­100 centiseconds (0.1 to 1.0 seconds). The factory default is 20 centiseconds
                   (0.2 seconds). The finest granularity of specification is 1 centisecond (0.01 seconds).

 Leave Timer       The period of time to wait after receiving an unregister request for an attribute before
                   deleting the attribute. Current attributes are a VLAN or multicast group. This may be
                   considered a buffer time for another station to assert registration for the same attribute in
                   order to maintain uninterrupted service. There is an instance of this timer on a per-Port,
                   per-GARP participant basis. Permissible values are 20­600 centiseconds (0.2 to 6.0
                   seconds). The factory default is 60 centiseconds (0.6 seconds).
