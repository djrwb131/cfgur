   This chapter describes the routing commands.
   The chapter contains the following sections:
         Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Commands
         IP Routing Commands
         Virtual LAN Routing Commands
         DHCP and BOOTP Relay Commands
         IP Helper Commands
         ICMP Throttling Commands
   The commands in this chapter are in three functional groups:
         Show commands display switch settings, statistics, and other information.
         Configuration commands configure features and options of the switch. Every switch
          command has a show command that displays the configuration setting.
         Clear commands clear some or all of the settings to factory defaults.
