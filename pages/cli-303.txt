 Parameter                              Description

 assign-queue <queue-id>                Specifies the assign-queue, which is the queue identifier to
                                        which packets matching this rule are assigned.

 [{mirror | redirect} [lag              Specifies the mirror or redirect interface which is the
 <lag-group-id> | <slot/port>]          <lag-group-id> or <slot/port> to which packets
                                        matching this rule are copied or forwarded, respectively.

ip access-group
This command either attaches a specific IP ACL identified by <accesslistnumber> to an
interface or associates with a VLAN ID in a specific direction. The parameter <name> is the
name of the access control list.
An optional sequence number might be specified to indicate the order of this IP access list
relative to other IP access lists already assigned to this interface and direction. A lower
number indicates higher precedence order. If a sequence number is already in use for this
interface and direction, the specified access list replaces the currently attached IP access list
using that sequence number. If the sequence number is not specified for this command, a
sequence number that is one greater than the highest sequence number currently in use for
this interface and direction is used.
