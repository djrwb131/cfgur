 Field                            Description

 BR, nominal                      The nominal bit (signaling) rate (BR, nominal) is specified in units of
                                  100 MBd, rounded off to the nearest 100 MBd. The bit rate includes
                                  those bits necessary to encode and delimit the signal as well as those
                                  bits carrying data information. A value of 0 indicates that the bit rate is
                                  not specified and must be determined from the transceiver technology.
                                  The actual information transfer rate will depend on the encoding of the
                                  data, as defined by the encoding value.

 Vendor Rev                       The vendor revision number (vendor rev) contains ASCII characters,
                                  left aligned and padded on the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining
                                  the vendor's product revision number. A value of all zero in this field
                                  indicates that the vendor revision is unspecified.

show mac-addr-table
This command displays the forwarding database entries. These entries are used by the
transparent bridging function to determine how to forward a received frame.
Enter all or no parameter to display the entire table. Enter a MAC Address and VLAN ID to
display the table entry for the requested MAC address on the specified VLAN. Enter the
count parameter to view summary information about the forwarding database table. Use the
interface <slot/port> parameter to view MAC addresses on a specific interface. Use
the vlan <vlan-id> parameter to display information about MAC addresses on a specified
VLAN.

 Format        show mac-addr-table [{<macaddr> <vlan-id> | all | count | interface
               <slot/port> | vlan <vlan-id>}]
