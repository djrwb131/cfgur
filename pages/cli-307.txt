    Note: An implicit deny all IPv6 rule always terminates the access list.

A rule might either deny or permit traffic according to the specified classification fields. At a
minimum, either the every keyword or the protocol, source address, and destination
address values must be specified. The source and destination IPv6 address fields might be
specified using the any keyword to indicate a match on any value in that field. The remaining
command parameters are all optional, but the most frequently used parameters appear in the
same relative order as shown in the command format.
The assign-queue parameter allows specification of a particular hardware queue for handling
traffic that matches this rule. The allowed <queue-id> value is 0-(n-1), where n is the
number of user configurable queues available for the hardware platform. The
assign-queue parameter is valid only for a permit rule.
The mirror parameter allows the traffic matching this rule to be copied to the specified
<slot/port>, while the redirect parameter allows the traffic matching this rule to be
forwarded to the specified <slot/port>. The assign-queue and redirect parameters
are only valid for a permit rule.
The time-range parameter allows imposing time limitation on the IPv6 ACL rule as defined
by the parameter <time-range-name>. If a time range with the specified name does not
exist and the IPv6 ACL containing this ACL rule is applied to an interface or bound to a
VLAN, then the ACL rule is applied immediately. If a time range with specified name exists
and the IPv6 ACL containing this ACL rule is applied to an interface or bound to a VLAN, then
the ACL rule is applied when the time-range with specified name becomes active. The ACL
rule is removed when the time-range with specified name becomes inactive.

 Mode         IPv6-Access-List Config

ipv6 traffic-filter
This command either attaches a specific IPv6 ACL identified by <name> to an interface or
associates with a VLAN ID in a specific direction. The <name> parameter must be the name
of an existing IPv6 ACL.
An optional sequence number might be specified to indicate the order of this mac access list
relative to other IPv6 access lists already assigned to this interface and direction. A lower
number indicates higher precedence order. If a sequence number is already in use for this
interface and direction, the specifiedIPv6 access list replaces the currently attached IPv6
access list using that sequence number. If the sequence number is not specified for this
command, a sequence number that is one greater than the highest sequence number
currently in use for this interface and direction is used.
This command specified in Interface Config mode only affects a single interface, whereas the
Global Config mode setting is applied to all interfaces. The vlan keyword is valid only in the
