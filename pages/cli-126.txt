                       M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

A VLAN can be configured as the source to a session (all member ports of that VLAN are
monitored). Remote port mirroring is configured by adding the RSPAN VLAN ID. At the
source switch, the destination is configured as the RSPAN VLAN and at the destination
switch, the source is configured as the RSPAN VLAN.

    Note: The source and destination cannot be configured as remote on the
          same device.

The reflector-port is configured at the source switch. The reflector-port forwards the mirrored
traffic towards the destination switch.

    Note: This port must be configured with RSPAN VLAN membership.

IP/MAC ACL can be attached to a session by giving the access list number/name.
Use the destination interface <slot/port> to specify the interface to receive the
monitored traffic.
Use the mode parameter to enable the administrative mode of the session. If enabled, the
probe port monitors all the traffic received and transmitted on the physical monitored port.
Use the filter parameter to filter a specified access group either by IP address or MAC
address.

 Format        monitor session <session-id> {source {interface <slot/port> | cpu
               | vlan <vlan-id> | remote vlan <vlan-id>} [{rx | tx}] |
               destination {interface <slot/port> | remote vlan <vlan-id>
               reflector-port <slot/port>} | mode}

 Mode          Global Config

Command example:
To configure the RSPAN VLAN source:
monitor session <session-id> source {interface <slot/port> | vlan <vlan-id> | remote vlan
<vlan-id>} [rx | tx]

Command example:
To the configure RSPAN VLAN destination:
monitor session <session-id> destination {interface <slot/port> | remote vlan <vlan-id>
reflector-port <slot/port>}
