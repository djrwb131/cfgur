ip arp inspection limit
Use this command to configure the rate limit and burst interval values for an interface.
Configuring none for the limit means that the interface is not rate limited for Dynamic ARP
Inspections.

    Note: The user interface will accept a rate limit for a trusted interface, but
            the limit will not be enforced unless the interface is configured to be
            untrusted.

 Default     15 pps for rate and 1 second for burst-interval

 Format      ip arp inspection limit {rate <pps> [burst interval <seconds>] |
             none}
