no mvr group

This command removes the MVR membership group.

 Format      no mvr group <A.B.C.D> [count]

 Mode        Global Config

mvr mode
This command changes the MVR mode type. If the mode is set to compatible, the switch
does not learn multicast groups; they need to be configured by the operator as the protocol
does not forward joins from the hosts to the router. To operate in this mode, the IGMP router
needs to be statically configured to transmit all required multicast streams to the MVR switch.
If the mode is set to dynamic, the switch learns existing multicast groups by snooping the
IGMP queries from router on source ports and forwarding the IGMP joins from the hosts to
the IGMP router on the multicast VLAN (with appropriate translation of the VLAN ID).
