the <mstid> parameter. You can set the path cost as a number in the range of 1­200000000
or auto. If you select auto the path cost value is set based on Link Speed.
If you specify the external-cost option, this command sets the external-path cost for MST
instance 0 that is, CIST instance. You can set the external cost as a number in the range of
1­200000000 or auto. If you specify auto, the external path cost value is set based on Link
Speed.
If you specify the port-priority option, this command sets the priority for this port within a
specific multiple spanning tree instance or the Common and Internal Spanning Tree instance,
depending on the <mstid> parameter. The port-priority value is a number in the range of
0­240 in increments of 16.

This command sets the Path Cost or Port Priority for this port within the multiple spanning
tree instance, or in the Common and Internal Spanning Tree to the respective default values.
If you specify an <mstid> parameter that corresponds to an existing multiple spanning tree
instance, you are configuring that multiple spanning tree instance. If you specify 0 (defined as
the default CIST ID) as the <mstid>, you are configuring the Common and Internal
Spanning Tree instance.
If you specify cost, this command sets the path cost for this port within a multiple spanning
tree instance or the Common and Internal Spanning Tree instance, depending on the
<mstid> parameter, to the default value, that is, a path cost value based on the Link Speed.
If you specify external-cost, this command sets the external path cost for this port for mst
`0' instance, to the default value, that is, a path cost value based on the Link Speed.
If you specify port-priority, this command sets the priority for this port within a specific
multiple spanning tree instance or the Common and Internal Spanning Tree instance,
depending on the <mstid> parameter, to the default value.

 Format       no spanning-tree mst <mstid> [cost | external-cost | port-priority]
