show trapflags
Use this command to display trap conditions. The command's display shows all the enabled
OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 trap flags. Configure which traps the switch should generate by
enabling or disabling the trap condition. If a trap condition is enabled and the condition is
detected, the SNMP agent on the switch sends the trap to all enabled trap receivers. You do
not have to reset the switch to implement the changes. Cold and warm start traps are always
generated and cannot be disabled.
