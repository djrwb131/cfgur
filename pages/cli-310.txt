absolute
Use this command to add an absolute time entry to a time range. Only one absolute time
entry is allowed per time-range. The <time> parameters are based on the currently
configured time zone. The [start <time> <date>] parameters indicate the time and
date at which the configuration that referenced the time range starts going into effect. The
time is expressed in a 24-hour clock, in the form of hours:minutes. For example, 8:00 is 8:00
am and 20:00 is 8:00 pm. The date is expressed in the format day month year. If no start time
and date are specified, the configuration statement is in effect immediately. The [end
<time> <date>] parameters indicate the time and date at which the configuration that
referenced the time range is no longer in effect. The end time and date must be after the start
time and date. If no end time and date are specified, the configuration statement is in effect
indefinitely.

periodic
Use this command to add a periodic time entry to a time range. The <time> parameters are
based off the currently configured time zone. The first occurrence of the
<days-of-the-week> argument is the starting day(s) from which the configuration that
referenced the time range starts going into effect. The second occurrence is the ending day
or days from which the configuration that referenced the time range is no longer in effect. If
the end days-of-the-week are the same as the start, they can be omitted This argument can
be any single day or combinations of days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday. Other possible values are:
·   daily--Monday through Sunday
·   weekdays--Monday through Friday
·   weekend--Saturday and Sunday
If the ending days of the week are the same as the starting days of the week, they can be
omitted. The first occurrence of the <time> argument is the starting hours:minutes which
the configuration that referenced the time range starts going into effect. The second
occurrence is the ending hours:minutes at which the configuration that referenced the time
range is no longer in effect. The hours:minutes are expressed in a 24-hour clock. For
example, 8:00 is 8:00 am and 20:00 is 8:00 pm
The frequency is how often this periodic entry will become active. If the value is set to 0, the
timer schedule will be treated as absolute.
