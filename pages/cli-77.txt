 Term              Definition

 Interface         Valid slot and port number separated by forward slashes.

 Join Timer        The interval between the transmission of GARP PDUs registering (or re-registering)
                   membership for an attribute. Current attributes are a VLAN or multicast group. There is
                   an instance of this timer on a per-Port, per-GARP participant basis. Permissible values
                   are 10­100 centiseconds (0.1 to 1.0 seconds). The factory default is 20 centiseconds
                   (0.2 seconds). The finest granularity of specification is one centisecond (0.01 seconds).

 Leave Timer       The period of time to wait after receiving an unregister request for an attribute before
                   deleting the attribute. Current attributes are a VLAN or multicast group. This may be
                   considered a buffer time for another station to assert registration for the same attribute in
                   order to maintain uninterrupted service. There is an instance of this timer on a per-Port,
                   per-GARP participant basis. Permissible values are 20­600 centiseconds (0.2 to 6.0
                   seconds). The factory default is 60 centiseconds (0.6 seconds).
