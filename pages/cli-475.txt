passwords lock-out
Use this command to strengthen the security of the switch by locking user accounts that have
failed login due to wrong passwords. When a lockout count is configured, a user that is
logged in must enter the correct password within that count. Otherwise the user will be locked
out from further switch access. Only a user with read/write access can reactivate a locked
user account. Password lockout does not apply to logins from the serial console. The valid
range is 1-5. The default is 0, or no lockout count enforced.
