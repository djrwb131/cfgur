vlan participation
This command configures the degree of participation for a specific interface in a VLAN. The
ID is a valid VLAN identification number, and the interface is a valid interface number.

 Format        vlan participation {exclude | include | auto} <1-4093>

 Mode          Interface Config

Participation options are:

 Participation     Definition
 Options

 include          The interface is always a member of this VLAN. This is equivalent to registration fixed.

 exclude          The interface is never a member of this VLAN. This is equivalent to registration
                   forbidden.

 auto             The interface is dynamically registered in this VLAN by GVRP. The interface will not
                   participate in this VLAN unless a join request is received on this interface. This is
                   equivalent to registration normal.

This command configures the degree of participation for all interfaces in a VLAN. The ID is a
valid VLAN identification number.
