                            M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

 Field                   Definition

 Remote Tw_sys_rx        Integer that indicates the value of Tw_sys that the remote system requests from the
 (microsec)              local system. This value maps from the aLldpXdot3RemRxTwSys attribute.

 Remote Tw_sys_rx Echo   Integer that indicates the value of Receive Tw_sys echoed back by the remote
 (microsec)              system. This value maps from the aLldpXdot3RemRxTwSysEcho attribute.

 Remote Fallback Tw_sys  Integer that indicates the value of fallback Tw_sys that the remote system is
 (microsec)              advertising. This attribute maps to the variable RemFbSystemValue as defined in
                         78.4.2.3.

 Tx_dll_enabled          Initialization status of the EEE transmit Data Link Layer management function on the
                         local system.

 Tx_dll_ready            Data Link Layer ready: This variable indicates that the tx system initialization is
                         complete and is ready to update/receive LLDPDU containing EEE TLV. This variable
                         is updated by the local system software.

 Rx_dll_enabled          Status of the EEE capability negotiation on the local system.

 Rx_dll_ready            Data Link Layer ready: This variable indicates that the rx system initialization is
                         complete and is ready to update/receive LLDPDU containing EEE TLV. This variable
                         is updated by the local system software.

 Cumulative Energy       Estimated Cumulative energy saved on this port in (Watts * hours) due to all green
 Saving                  modes enabled

 Time Since Counters     Time Since Counters Last Cleared (since the time of power up, or after 'clear eee
 Last Cleared            counters' is executed)

     Note: Executing the clear green-mode statistics command clears
             only the EEE Transmit, Receive LPI event count, LPI duration, and
             Cumulative Energy Savings Estimates of the port. Other status
             parameters listed in the previous table remain unaffected after you
             executed the clear green-mode statistics command.

Command example:
(NETGEAR Switch) #show green-mode

Current Power Consumption (mW).............. XX
Power Saving (%)............................ XX
Cumulative Energy Saving /Stack (W * H)... XX
