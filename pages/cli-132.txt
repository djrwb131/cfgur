show mac-address-table static
This command displays the static MAC filtering information for all static MAC filters. If you
select all, all the static MAC filters in the system are displayed. If you supply a value for
<macaddr>, you must also enter a value for <vlanid>, and the system displays static
MAC filter information only for that MAC address and VLAN.

 Term            Definition

 Mac Address     A unicast MAC address for which the switch has forwarding and or filtering information.
                 As the data is gleaned from the MFDB, the address will be a multicast address. The
                 format is 6 or 8 two-digit hexadecimal numbers that are separated by colons, for example
                 01:23:45:67:89:AB. In an IVL system the MAC address will be displayed as 8 bytes.

 Type            The type of the entry. Static entries are those that are configured by the end user.
                 Dynamic entries are added to the table as a result of a learning process or protocol.

 Description     The text description of this multicast table entry.

 Interfaces      The list of interfaces that are designated for forwarding (Fwd:) and filtering (Flt:).
