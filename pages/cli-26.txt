Loopback Interface Commands

   The commands in this section describe how to create, delete, and manage loopback
   interfaces. A loopback interface is always expected to be up. This interface can provide the
   source address for sent packets and can receive both local and remote packets. The
   loopback interface is typically used by routing protocols.
   To assign an IP address to the loopback interface, see ip address on page 234.

   interface loopback
   Use this command to enter the Interface Config mode for a loopback interface. The range of
   the loopback ID is 0­7.

     Format        interface loopback <loopback-id>

     Mode          Global Config

   no interface loopback

   This command removes the loopback interface and associated configuration parameters for
   the specified loopback interface.

     Format        no interface loopback <loopback-id>

     Mode          Global Config

   show interface loopback
   This command displays information about configured loopback interfaces.

     Format        show interface loopback [<loopback-id>]

     Mode          Privileged EXEC

   If you do not specify a loopback ID, the following information appears for each loopback
   interface on the system:

     Term             Definition

     Loopback ID      The loopback ID associated with the rest of the information in the row.

     Interface        The interface name.

     IP Address       The IPv4 address of the interface.

     Received         The number of packets received on this interface.
