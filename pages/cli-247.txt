show ip route ecmp-groups
This command reports all current ECMP groups in the IPv4 routing table. An ECMP group is
a set of two or more next hops used in one or more routes. The groups are numbered
arbitrarily from 1 to n. The output indicates the number of next hops in the group and the
number of routes that use the set of next hops. The output lists the IPv4 address and
outgoing interface of each next hop in each group.

 Format       show ip route ecmp-groups

 Mode         Privileged EXEC

Command example:
(NETGEAR Switch) #show ip route ecmp-groups

ECMP Group 1 with 2 next hops (used by 1 route)
  172.20.33.100 on interface 2/33
  172.20.34.100 on interface 2/34

ECMP Group 2 with 3 next hops (used by 1 route)
  172.20.32.100 on interface 2/32
  172.20.33.100 on interface 2/33
  172.20.34.100 on interface 2/34

ECMP Group 3 with 4 next hops (used by 1 route)
  172.20.31.100 on interface 2/31
