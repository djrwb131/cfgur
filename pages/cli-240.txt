OSPF advertises the IP MTU in the Database Description packets it sends to its neighbors
during database exchange. If two OSPF neighbors advertise different IP MTUs, they will not
form an adjacency. (unless OSPF has been instructed to ignore differences in IP MTU with
the ip ospf mtu-ignore command.)

    Note: The IP MTU size refers to the maximum size of the IP packet (IP
          Header + IP payload). It does not include any extra bytes that might
          be required for Layer-2 headers. To receive and process packets, the
          Ethernet MTU must take into account the size of the Ethernet header.

 Default     1500 bytes

 Format      ip mtu <68-9198>

 Mode        Interface Config

no ip mtu

This command resets the IP MTU to the default value.

 Format      no ip mtu

encapsulation
This command configures the link layer encapsulation type for the packet. The encapsulation
type can be ethernet or snap.

 Default     ethernet

    Note: Routed frames are always Ethernet encapsulated when a frame is
          routed to a VLAN.

clear ip route all
This command removes all the route entries learned over the network.
