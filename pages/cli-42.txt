If you specify 0 (defined as the default CIST ID) as the <mstid>, this command displays the
settings and parameters for a specific switch port within the Common and Internal Spanning
Tree. The <slot/port> is the desired switch port. In this case, the following are displayed.

 Term              Definition

 Port Identifier   The port identifier for this port within the CST.

 Port Priority     The priority of the port within the CST.

 Port Forwarding   The forwarding state of the port within the CST.
 State

 Port Role         The role of the specified interface within the CST.

 Auto-Calculate    Indicates whether auto calculation for port path cost is enabled or not (disabled).
 Port Path Cost

 Port Path Cost    The configured path cost for the specified interface.

 Auto-Calculate    Indicates whether auto calculation for external port path cost is enabled.
 External Port
 Path Cost

 External Port     The cost to get to the root bridge of the CIST across the boundary of the region. This
 Path Cost         means that if the port is a boundary port for an MSTP region, the external path cost is
                   used.

 Designated Root   Identifier of the designated root for this port within the CST.

 Root Path Cost    The root path cost to the LAN by the port.

 Designated        The bridge containing the designated port.
 Bridge

 Designated Port   Port on the Designated Bridge that offers the lowest cost to the LAN.
 Identifier

 Topology          Value of flag in next Configuration Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) transmission
 Change            indicating if a topology change is in progress for this port.
 Acknowledgeme
 nt

 Hello Time        The hello time in use for this port.
