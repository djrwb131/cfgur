telnetcon timeout
Use this command to set the Telnet connection session time-out value, in minutes. A session
is active as long as the session has not been idle for the value set. The time is a decimal
value from 1 to 160.

    Note: When you change the time-out value, the new value is applied to all
            active and inactive sessions immediately. Any sessions that have
            been idle longer than the new time-out value are disconnected
            immediately.

 Default       5

 Format        telnetcon timeout <1-160>

 Mode          Privileged EXEC

no telnetcon timeout

Use this command to set the Telnet connection session timeout value to the default.

    Note: Changing the time-out value for active sessions does not become
            effective until the session is reaccessed. Also, any keystroke activates
            the new time-out duration.

 Format        no telnetcon timeout

 Mode          Privileged EXEC
