match class-map
This command adds to the specified class definition the set of match conditions defined for
another class. The <refclassname> is the name of an existing DiffServ class whose match
conditions are being referenced by the specified class definition.

 Default  none

 Format   match class-map <refclassname>

 Mode       Class-Map Config
            Ipv6-Class-Map Config

Note the following:
   The parameters <refclassname> and <class-map-name> cannot be the same.
   Only one other class might be referenced by a class.
  Any attempts to delete the <refclassname> class while the class is still referenced by
    any <class-map-name> fails.
   The combined match criteria of <class-map-name> and <refclassname> must be an
    allowed combination based on the class type.
  Any subsequent changes to the <refclassname> class match criteria must maintain
    this validity, or the change attempt fails.
   The total number of class rules formed by the complete reference class chain (including
    both predecessor and successor classes) must not exceed a platform-specific maximum.
    In some cases, each removal of a refclass rule reduces the maximum number of
    available rules in the class definition by one.
