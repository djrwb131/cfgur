Static and dynamic modes differ in how the available power is calculated, as follows:
   Static Power Management
   Available power = power limit of the source - total allocated power where total allocated
    power is calculated as the power limit configured on the port.
   Dynamic Power Management
   Available power = power limit of the source - total allocated power, where total allocated
    power is calculated as the amount of power consumed by the port.
For example, assume that the power limit of the source is 300 watts. One port is powered up
and is drawing 3 watts of power. The power limit defined on the port is user-defined as
15 watts. In this case, the available power for static and dynamic would be as follows:
   Static Power Management
   Available power = 300 watts - 15 watts = 285 watts
   Dynamic Power Management
   Available power = 300 watts - 3 watts = 297 watts

poe priority
Use this command to configure the priority on a specific port. This is used for power
management purposes. The switch might not be able to supply power to all connected
devices, so the port priority is used to determine which ports will supply power if adequate
power capacity is not available for all enabled ports. For ports that have the same priority
level, the lower numbered port will have higher priority. There are three options:
   crit. Critical priority
   high. High priority
   low. Low priority
