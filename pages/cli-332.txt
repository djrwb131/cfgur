delete
This command deletes the supplied image file from the permanent storage. The image to be
deleted must be a backup image. If this image is the active image, or if this image is
activated, an error message displays. The optional <unit> parameter is valid only on
Stacks. Error will be returned, if this parameter is provided, on Standalone systems. In a
stack, the <unit> parameter identifies the node on which this command must be executed.
When this parameter is not supplied, the command is executed on all nodes in a Stack.

 Format     delete [<unit>] {image1 | image2}

 Mode       Privileged EXEC

boot system
This command activates the specified image. It will be the active-image for subsequent
reboots and will be loaded by the boot loader. The current active-image is marked as the
backup-image for subsequent reboots. The optional <unit> parameter is valid only in
Stacking, where the <unit> parameter identifies the node on which this command must be
executed. When this parameter is not supplied, the command is executed on all nodes in a
Stack.

 Format     boot system [<unit>] <image-file-name>

 Mode       Privileged EXEC

show bootvar
This command displays the version information and the activation status for the current active
and backup images on the supplied unit (node) of the Stack. If you do not specify a unit
number, the command displays image details for all nodes on the Stack. The command also
displays any text description associated with an image. This command, when used on a
Standalone system, displays the switch activation status. For a standalone system, the unit
parameter is not valid.

 Format     show bootvar [<unit>]

 Mode       Privileged EXEC

filedescr
This command associates a text description with an image. Any existing description will be
replaced. For stacking, the [<unit>] parameter identifies the node on which this command
must be executed. When this parameter is not supplied, the command is executed on all
nodes in a Stack.

 Format     filedescr [<unit>] {image1 | image2} <text-description>

 Mode       Privileged EXEC
