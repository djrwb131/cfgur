     Note: If you use the connected keyword for <protocol>, the all option is
            not available because there are no best or non-best connected routes.

 Format        show ip route [{<ip-address> [<protocol>] | {<ip-address> <mask>
               [longer-prefixes] [<protocol>] | <protocol>} [all] | all}]

 Modes          Privileged EXEC

 Term            Definition

 Route Codes     The key for the routing protocol codes that might appear in the routing table output.

The show ip route command displays the routing tables in the following format:
Code    IP-Address/Mask [Preference/Metric] via Next-Hop, Route-Timestamp, Interface

The columns for the routing table display the following information:

 Term              Definition

 Code              The codes for the routing protocols that created the routes.

 IP-Address/Mask   The IP-Address and mask of the destination network corresponding to this route.

 Preference        The administrative distance associated with this route. Routes with low values are
                   preferred over routes with higher values.

 Metric            The cost associated with this route.

 via Next-Hop      The outgoing router IP address to use when forwarding traffic to the next router (if any)
                   in the path toward the destination.

 Route-Timestamp   The last updated time for dynamic routes. The format of Route-Timestamp will be
                      Days:Hours:Minutes if days > = 1
                      Hours:Minutes:Seconds if days < 1

 Interface         The outgoing router interface to use when forwarding traffic to the next destination. For
                   reject routes, the next hop interface would be Null0 interface.

To administratively control the traffic destined to a particular network and prevent it from
being forwarded through the router, you can configure a static reject route on the router. Such
traffic would be discarded and the ICMP destination unreachable message is sent back to the
source. This is typically used for preventing routing loops. The reject route added in the RTO
is of the type OSPF Inter-Area. Reject routes (routes of REJECT type installed by any
protocol) are not redistributed by OSPF/RIP. Reject routes are supported in both OSPFv2
and OSPFv3.
