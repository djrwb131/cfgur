match source-address mac
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the source
MAC address of a packet. The <address> parameter is any layer 2 MAC address formatted
as six, two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (for example, 00:11:22:dd:ee:ff).
The <macmask> parameter is a layer 2 MAC address bit mask, which might not be
contiguous, and is formatted as six, two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (for
example, ff:07:23:ff:fe:dc).

 Default       none

 Format        match source-address mac <address> <macmask>

 Mode          · Class-Map Config
               · Ipv6-Class-Map Config

match srcip
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the source
IP address of a packet. The <ipaddr> parameter specifies an IP address. The <ipmask>
parameter specifies an IP address bit mask and must consist of a contiguous set of leading 1
bits.

 Default       none

 Format        match srcip <ipaddr> <ipmask>

 Mode          Class-Map Config

match srcip6
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the source
IP address of a packet.

 Default       none

 Format        match srcip6 <source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length>

 Mode          Ipv6-Class-Map Config

match srcl4port
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the source
layer 4 port of a packet using a single keyword or numeric notation. To specify the match
condition as a single keyword notation, the value for <portkey> is one of the supported port
name keywords (listed below). The currently supported <portkey> values are: domain,
echo, ftp, ftpdata, http, smtp, snmp, telnet, tftp, www. Each of these translates into
its equivalent port number, which is used as both the start and end of a port range.
To specify the match condition as a numeric value, one layer 4-port number is required. The
port number is an integer from 0 to 65535.
