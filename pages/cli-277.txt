match ip dscp
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the value of
the IP DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) field in a packet, which is defined as the high-order six
bits of the Service Type octet in the IP header (the low-order two bits are not checked).
The <dscpval> value is specified as either an integer from 0 to 63, or symbolically through
one of the following keywords: af11, af12, af13, af21, af22, af23, af31, af32, af33, af41, af42,
af43, be, cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3, cs4, cs5, cs6, cs7, ef.

    Note: The match ip dscp, match ip precedence, and match ip
            tos commands provide alternative ways to specify a match criterion
            for the same Service Type field in the IP header, but each command
            requires a slightly different user notation.

 Default       none

 Format        match ip dscp <dscpval>

 Mode          · Class-Map Config
               · Ipv6-Class-Map Config

match ip precedence
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the value of
the IP Precedence field in a packet, which is defined as the high-order three bits of the
Service Type octet in the IP header (the low-order five bits are not checked). The precedence
value is an integer from 0 to 7.

    Note: The match ip dscp, match ip precedence, and match ip
            tos commands provide alternative ways to specify a match criterion
            for the same Service Type field in the IP header, but each command
            requires a slightly different user notation.

 Default       none

 Format        match ip precedence <0-7>

 Mode          Class-Map Config

match ip tos
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the value of
the IP ToS field in a packet, which is defined as all eight bits of the Service Type octet in the
IP header. The value of <tosbits> is a two-digit hexadecimal number from 00 to ff. The
value of <tosmask> is a two-digit hexadecimal number from 00 to ff. The <tosmask>
