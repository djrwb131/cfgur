dot1x system-auth-control monitor
Use this command to enable the 802.1X monitor mode on the switch. The purpose of Monitor
mode is to help troubleshoot port-based authentication configuration issues without
disrupting network access for hosts connected to the switch. In Monitor mode, a host is
granted network access to an 802.1X-enabled port even if it fails the authentication process.
The results of the process are logged for diagnostic purposes.
