   CLI.
   The chapter contains the following sections:
         Class of Service (CoS) Commands
         Differentiated Services (DiffServ) Commands
         DiffServ Class Commands
         DiffServ Policy Commands
         DiffServ Service Commands
         DiffServ Show Commands
         MAC Access Control List (ACL) Commands

         IPv6 Access Control List (ACL) Commands
         Time Range Commands for Time-Based ACLs

   The commands in this chapter are in two functional groups:
         Show commands display switch settings, statistics, and other information.
         Configuration commands configure features and options of the switch. Every switch
          command has a show command that displays the configuration setting.
