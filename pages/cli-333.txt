   update bootcode
   This command updates the bootcode (boot loader) on the switch. The bootcode is read from
   the active-image for subsequent reboots. The optional <unit> parameter is valid only on
   Stacks. Error will be returned, if this parameter is provided, on Standalone systems. For
   Stacking, the <unit> parameter identifies the node on which this command must be
   executed. When this parameter is not supplied, the command is executed on all nodes in a
   Stack.

     Format      update bootcode [<unit>]

     Mode        Privileged EXEC
