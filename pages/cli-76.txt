GVRP Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure and view GARP VLAN
   Registration Protocol (GVRP) information. GVRP-enabled switches exchange VLAN
   configuration information, which allows GVRP to provide dynamic VLAN creation on trunk
   ports and automatic VLAN pruning.

       Note: If GVRP is disabled, the system does not forward GVRP messages.

   set gvrp adminmode
   This command enables GVRP on the system.
