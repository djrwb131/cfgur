Double VLAN Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure double VLAN (DVLAN). Double
   VLAN tagging is a way to pass VLAN traffic from one customer domain to another through a
   Metro Core in a simple and cost effective manner. The additional tag on the traffic helps
   differentiate between customers in the MAN while preserving the VLAN identification of the
   individual customers when they enter their own 802.1Q domain.

   dvlan-tunnel ethertype
   This command configures the ether-type for all interfaces. The ether-type may have the
   values of 802.1Q, vman, or custom. If the ether-type has a value of custom, the optional
   value of the custom ether type must be set to a value from 0 to 65535.

     Default       vman

     Format        dvlan-tunnel ethertype {802.1Q | vman | custom} [<0-65535>]
