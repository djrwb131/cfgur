clock timezone
When using SNTP/NTP time servers to update the switch's clock, the time data received
from the server is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is the same as
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This might not be the time zone in which the switch is located.
Use the clock timezone command to configure a time zone specifying the number of
hours and optionally the number of minutes difference from UTC. To set the switch clock to
UTC, use the no form of the command.
