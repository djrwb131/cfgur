sflow sampler
A data source configured to collect flow samples is called a poller. Use this command to
configure a new sFlow sampler instance for this data source if <rcvr-idx> is valid.

 Format         sflow sampler {<rcvr-indx> | rate <sampling-rate> | maxheadersize
                <size>}

 Mode           Interface Config

 Field            Description

 Receiver Index   The sFlow Receiver for this sFlow sampler to which flow samples are to be sent. A value
                  of zero (0) means that no receiver is configured, no packets will be sampled. Only active
                  receivers can be set. If a receiver expires, then all samplers associated with the receiver
                  will also expire. Possible values are 1-8. The default is 0.

 Sampling Rate    The statistical sampling rate for packet sampling from this source. A value of zero (0)
                  disables sampling. A value of N means that out of N incoming packets, 1 packet will be
                  sampled. The range is 1024-65536 and 0. The default is 0.
                  When you issue a show command for the sampling rate, the configured sampling rate on
                  an interface changes. Each time that you configure a sampling rate, a threshold value is
                  calculated. This threshold value is configured in the hardware register. When you issue a
                  show command for the sampling rate, the threshold value is queried from the hardware
                  and the sampling rate is calculated in the following way:
                  threshold value = 2^24/ (sampling rate)
                  Because only an integer operation is supported, the sampling rate is not the same as the
                  configured value.
                  The following is an example:
                  configured sampling rate is 60000
                  threshold value = 2^24/ (60000) = 279 (from integer division)
                  recalculated sampling rate = 2^24/ (279) = 60133

 Maxheadersize    The maximum number of bytes that should be copied from the sampler packet. The
                  range is 20-256. The default is 128. When set to zero (0), all the sampler parameters are
                  set to their corresponding default value.

no sflow sampler

Use this command to reset the sFlow sampler instance to the default settings.

 Format         no sflow sampler {<rcvr-indx> | rate <sampling-rate> | maxheadersize
                <size>}
