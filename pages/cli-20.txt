mtu
Use the mtu command to set the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size, in bytes, for frames
that ingress or egress the interface. You can use the mtu command to configure jumbo frame
support for physical and port-channel (LAG) interfaces. The MTU size is a valid integer
between 1522­9216 for tagged packets and a valid integer between 1518­9216 for untagged
packets.

    Note: To receive and process packets, the Ethernet MTU must include any
          extra bytes that Layer-2 headers might require. To configure the IP
          MTU size, which is the maximum size of the IP packet (IP Header + IP
          payload), see ip mtu on page 239.
