 Tokens              Definition

 quiet-period       The value, in seconds, of the timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port
                     to define periods of time in which it will not attempt to acquire a supplicant. The
                     quiet-period must be a value in the range 0 - 65535.

 tx-period          The value, in seconds, of the timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port
                     to determine when to send an EAPOL EAP Request/Identity frame to the supplicant. The
                     quiet-period must be a value in the range 1 - 65535.

                     to timeout the supplicant. The supp-timeout must be a value in the range 1 - 65535.

 server-timeout     The value, in seconds, of the timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port
                     to timeout the authentication server. The supp-timeout must be a value in the range 1 -
                     65535.
