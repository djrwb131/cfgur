mvr immediate
This command enables MVR immediate leave mode. MVR has two modes of operating with
the IGMP Leave messages: normal leave and immediate leave:
·   In normal leave mode, when a leave is received, the general IGMP query is sent from a
    Layer 2 switch to the receiver port, where the leave was received. Then reports are
    received from other interested hosts that are also connected to that port, for example,
    using hub.
·   In immediate leave mode, when a leave is received, the switch is immediately
    reconfigured not to forward a specific multicast stream to the port where a message is
    received. This mode is used only for ports where only one client might be connected.

 Default       Disabled
