Auto Install Commands

   This section describes the Auto Install Commands. Auto Install is a software feature which
   provides for the configuration of a switch automatically when the device is initialized and no
   configuration file is found on the switch. The Auto Install process requires DHCP to be
   enabled by default in order for it to be completed. The downloaded config file is not
   automatically saved to the startup-config. An administrator must explicitly issue a save
   request in order to save the configuration. The Auto Install process depends upon the
   configuration of other devices in the network, including a DHCP or BOOTP server, a TFTP
   server and, if necessary, a DNS server.
   There are three steps to Auto Install:
   1.  Configuration or assignment of an IP address for the device.
   2. Assignment of a TFTP server.
   3.  Obtain a configuration file for the device from the TFTP server.
