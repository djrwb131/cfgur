ip mtu
This command sets the IP maximum transmission unit (MTU) on a routing interface. The IP
MTU is the size of the largest IP packet that can be transmitted on the interface without
fragmentation. The software currently does not fragment IP packets.
·   Packets forwarded in hardware ignore the IP MTU.
·   Packets forwarded in software are dropped if they exceed the IP MTU of the outgoing
    interface.
Packets originated on the router, such as OSPF packets, might be fragmented by the IP
stack. The IP stack uses its default IP MTU and ignores the value set using the ip mtu
command.
