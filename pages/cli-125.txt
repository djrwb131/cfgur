Port Mirroring Commands

   Port mirroring, which is also known as port monitoring, selects network traffic that you can
   analyze with a network analyzer, such as a SwitchProbe device or other Remote Monitoring
   (RMON) probe.

   monitor session
   This command configures a probe port and a monitored port for monitor session (port
   monitoring). Use the source interface <slot/port> parameter to specify the interface
   to monitor. Use rx to monitor only ingress packets or use tx to monitor only egress packets.
   If you do not specify an rx or tx option, the destination port monitors both ingress and
   egress packets.
