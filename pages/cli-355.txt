logging syslog source-interface
This command configures the syslog source interface (source IP address) for the syslog
server configuration. The IP address of the selected source interface is used for filling the
IP header of management protocol packets. This allows security devices (firewalls) to identify
the source packets coming from the specific switch. If a source interface is not specified, the
primary IP address of the originating (outbound) interface is used as the source address.
