storm-control broadcast rate (Interface Config)
Use this command to configure the broadcast storm recovery threshold for an interface in
packets per second. If the mode is enabled, broadcast storm recovery is active, and if the
rate of L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured
threshold, the traffic is dropped. Therefore, the rate of broadcast traffic is limited to the
configured threshold.

 Default       0

 Format        storm-control broadcast rate <0-14880000>

 Mode          Interface Config

no storm-control broadcast rate

This command sets the broadcast storm recovery threshold to the default value for an
interface and disables broadcast storm recovery.

 Format        no storm-control broadcast rate

 Mode          Interface Config

storm-control broadcast (Global Config)
This command enables broadcast storm recovery mode for all interfaces. If the mode is
enabled, broadcast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of L2 broadcast traffic ingressing
on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic will be dropped.
Therefore, the rate of broadcast traffic will be limited to the configured threshold.

 Default       disabled

 Format        storm-control broadcast

 Mode          Global Config

no storm-control broadcast

This command disables broadcast storm recovery mode for all interfaces.

 Format        no storm-control broadcast

 Mode          Global Config

storm-control broadcast level (Global Config)
This command configures the broadcast storm recovery threshold for all interfaces as a
percentage of link speed and enables broadcast storm recovery. If the mode is enabled,
broadcast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an
interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic will be dropped. Therefore,
