System Utility and Clear Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to help troubleshoot connectivity issues and to
   restore various configurations to their factory defaults.

   traceroute
   Use the this command to discover the routes that packets actually take when traveling to
   their destination through the network on a hop-by-hop basis. Traceroute continues to provide
   a synchronous response when initiated from the CLI.

     Default     ·      count: 3 probes
                 ·      interval: 3 seconds
                 ·      size: 0 bytes
                 ·      port: 33434
                 ·      maxTtl: 30 hops
                 ·      maxFail: 5 probes
                 ·      initTtl: 1 hop

     Format      traceroute {<ip-address> | <hostname>} [initTtl <initTtl>] [maxTtl
                 <maxTtl>] [maxFail <maxFail>] [interval <interval>] [count <count>]
                 [port <port>] [size <size>] [source {<ip-address> | <slot/port> |
                 loopback <0-7>}]

     Mode        Privileged EXEC

   Using the options described below, you can specify the initial and maximum time-to-live
   (TTL) in probe packets, the maximum number of failures before termination, the number of
   probes sent for each TTL, and the size of each probe.

     Parameter                                Description

     {<ip-address> | <hostname>}              The <ip-address> value must be a valid IP address. The
                                              <hostname> value must be a a valid host name.

     [initTtl <initTtl>]                      As an option, specify the initial time-to-live (TTL), the maximum
                                              number of router hops between the local and remote system.
                                              Range is 0­255.

     [maxTtl <maxTtl>]                        As an option, specify the maximum TTL. Range is 1­255.
