storm-control broadcast (Interface Config)
Use this command to enable broadcast storm recovery mode for a specific interface. If the
mode is enabled, broadcast storm recovery is active and, if the rate of L2 broadcast traffic
ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic is dropped.
Therefore, the rate of broadcast traffic will be limited to the configured threshold.

 Default       enabled

 Format        storm-control broadcast

 Mode          Interface Config

no storm-control broadcast

Use this command to disable broadcast storm recovery mode for a specific interface.

storm-control broadcast level (Interface Config)
Use this command to configure the broadcast storm recovery threshold for an interface as a
percentage of link speed and enable broadcast storm recovery. If the mode is enabled,
broadcast storm recovery is active, and if the rate of L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an
interface increases beyond the configured threshold, the traffic is dropped. Therefore, the
rate of broadcast traffic is limited to the configured threshold.
If the shutdown option is selected, and the broadcast traffic increases beyond the threshold,
the interface shuts down instead of dropping packets. To recover the port, issue the no
shutdown command under the port manually.

 Default       5

 Format        storm-control broadcast level <0-100> {action [ratelimit |
               shutdown]}

 Mode          Interface Config

no storm-control broadcast level

This command sets the broadcast storm recovery threshold to the default value for an
interface and disables broadcast storm recovery.

 Format        no storm-control broadcast level
