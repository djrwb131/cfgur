sflow receiver
Use this command to configure the sFlow collector parameters (owner string, receiver
time-out, maximum datagram size, IP address, and port) for a poller.

 Format         sflow receiver <rcvr_idx> {owner <owner-string> {timeout
                <rcvr_timeout> | notimeout} | maxdatagram <size> | ip <ip> | port
                <port>}

 Mode           Global Config

 Field           Description

 Receiver Index  The sFlow Receiver for this sFlow sampler to which flow samples are to be sent. A value
                 of zero (0) means that no receiver is configured, no packets will be sampled. Only active
                 receivers can be set. If a receiver expires, then all samplers associated with the receiver
                 will also expire. Possible values are 1-8. The default is 0.

 Receiver Owner  The identity string for the receiver, the entity making use of this sFlowRcvrTable entry.
                 The range is 127 characters. The default is a null string. The empty string indicates that
                 the entry is currently unclaimed and the receiver configuration is reset to the default
                 values. An entity wishing to claim an sFlowRcvrTable entry must ensure that the entry is
                 unclaimed before trying to claim it. The entry is claimed by setting the owner string to a
                 non-null value. The entry must be claimed before assigning a receiver to a sampler or
                 poller.

 Receiver        The time, in seconds, remaining before the sampler or poller is released and stops
 Timeout         sending samples to receiver. A management entity wanting to maintain control of the
                 sampler is responsible for setting a new value before the old one expires. The allowed
                 range is 0-4294967295 seconds. The default is zero (0).

 Receiver Max    The maximum number of data bytes that can be sent in a single sample datagram. The
 Datagram Size   management entity should set this value to avoid fragmentation of the sFlow datagrams.
                 The allowed range is 200 ­9,116). The default is 1400.

 Receiver IP     The sFlow receiver IP address. If set to 0.0.0.0, no sFlow datagrams will be sent. The
                 default is 0.0.0.0.

 Receiver Port   The destination Layer4 UDP port for sFlow datagrams. The range is 1-65535. The
                 default is 6343.

no sflow receiver

Use this command to set the sFlow collector parameters back to the defaults.

 Format         no sflow receiver <rcvr_idx> [owner | maxdatagram | ip | port]
