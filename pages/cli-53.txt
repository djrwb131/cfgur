protocol vlan group
This command adds the physical interface to the protocol-based VLAN identified by
<groupid>. You can associate multiple interfaces with a group, but you can only associate
each interface and protocol combination with one group. If adding an interface to a group
causes any conflicts with protocols currently associated with the group, this command fails
and the interface(s) are not added to the group.
