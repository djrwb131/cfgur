no poe high-power

Use this command to disable the high-power mode. The port will support only IEEE 902.3af
devices.
This command works on a global basis or per interface.

 Format        no poe high-power

 Mode          Interface Config

poe power limit
Use this command to configure the type of power limit for a port. If the power limit type is
user-defined, the command also allows you to configure a maximum power limit.
There are three options:
   class-based. Allows the port to draw up to the maximum power based on the
    classification of the device connected.
   none. Allows the port to draw up to Class 0 maximum power if it is in low-power mode
    and up to Class 4 maximum power if it is in high-power mode.
   user-defined. Allows you to define the maximum power to the port. This can be a
    value from 3 through 32 watts.

 Default       User-defined, with a maximum of 30 watts

 Format        poe power limit {class-based | none | user-defined [<3000-32000>]}

 Mode             Global Config
                  Interface Config

no poe power limit

Use this command to set the power limit type to the default. It also sets the maximum power
limit to the default if the power limit type is user-defined.

 Format        no poe power limit [user-defined]

 Mode             Global Config
                  Interface Config

poe power management
Use this command to configure the power management mode based on each individual PoE
unit or on all PoE units.
Both the power management modes mentioned here will power up a device based on first
come, first served. When the available power is less than the power limit defined on a port, no
more power will be delivered.
