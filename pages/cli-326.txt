 Term           Definition

 Intf           Interface on which PoE is configured.

 Class          Class of the powered device according to the IEEE802.3af and IEEE802.3at definition.
                   Class Usage Max Power (watts)
                   0 Default 0.44-12.95
                   1 Optional 0.44-3.84
                   2 Optional 3.84-6.49
                   3 Optional 6.49-12.95
                   4 Optional 12.95-25.5

 Power          The power supplied to the powered device (in watts).

 Output Current The current supplied to the powered device (in mA).
 (mA)

 Output Voltage The voltage supplied to the powered device (in volts).
 (volts)

 Status         The Status field reports the state of power supplied to the port. The possible values are:
                   Disabled--The PoE function is disabled on this port.
                   Searching--The port is detecting the PoE device.
                   Delivering Power--The port is providing power to the PoE device.
                   Fault--The POE device is not IEEE compliant; no power is provided.
                  Test--The port is in testing state.
                   Other Fault--The port has experienced problems other than compliance issues.
                When a port begins to deliver power, there is a trap indicating so. When a port stops
                delivering power, there is a trap indicating so.

Command example:
