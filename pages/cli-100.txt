the rate of broadcast traffic will be limited to the configured threshold. This command also
enables broadcast storm recovery mode for all interfaces.
If the `shutdown' option is selected, and the broadcast traffic increases beyond the threshold,
the interface shuts down instead of dropping packets. To recover the port, issue `no
shutdown' under the port manually.

 Mode          Global Config

storm-control broadcast rate (Global Config)
Use this command to configure the broadcast storm recovery threshold for all interfaces in
packets per second. If the mode is enabled, broadcast storm recovery is active, and if the
rate of L2 broadcast traffic ingressing on an interface increases beyond the configured
threshold, the traffic is dropped. Therefore, the rate of broadcast traffic is limited to the
configured threshold.
