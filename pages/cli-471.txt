username snmpv3 encryption
Use this command to specify the encryption protocol used for the specified user. The valid
encryption protocols are des and none.
If you select des, you can specify the required key on the command line. The encryption key
must be 8­64 characters long. If you select the des protocol but do not provide a key, the
user is prompted for the key. When you use the des protocol, the login password is also used
as the SNMPv3 encryption password, so it must be a minimum of eight characters. If you
select none, you do not need to provide a key.
The <username> value is the login user name associated with the specified encryption. You
must enter the <username> in the same case you used when you added the user. To see
the case of the <username>, enter the show users command.

 Term           Definition

 User Name      The name the user enters to login using the serial port, Telnet, or web.

 Access Mode    Shows whether the user is able to change parameters on the switch (Read/Write) or is
                only able to view them (Read Only). As a factory default, the "admin" user has
                Read/Write access and the "guest" has Read Only access. There can only be one
                Read/Write user and up to five Read Only users.

 SNMPv3 Access  The SNMPv3 Access Mode. If the value is set to ReadWrite, the SNMPv3 user is able to
 Mode           set and retrieve parameters on the system. If the value is set to ReadOnly, the SNMPv3
                user is only able to retrieve parameter information. The SNMPv3 access mode might be
                different than the CLI and Web access mode.
