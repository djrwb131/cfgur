Accessing the CLI

   You can access the CLI by using a direct console connection or by using a telnet or SSH
   connection from a remote management host.
   For the initial connection, you must use a direct connection to the console port. You cannot
   access the system remotely until the system has an IP address, subnet mask, and default
   gateway. You can set the network configuration information manually, or you can configure
   the system to accept these settings from a BOOTP or DHCP server on your network. For
   more information, see Management Interface Commands on page 446.
