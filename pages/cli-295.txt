ibmsna, ipv4, ipv6, ipx, mplsmcast, mplsucast, netbios, novell, pppoe, and
rarp. Each of these translates into its equivalent Ethertype value or values.
The time-range parameter allows imposing time limitation on the MAC ACL rule as
defined by the parameter <time-range-name>. If a time range with the specified name
does not exist and the MAC ACL containing this ACL rule is applied to an interface or bound
to a VLAN, then the ACL rule is applied immediately. If a time range with a specified name
exists and the MAC ACL containing this ACL rule is applied to an interface or bound to a
VLAN, then the ACL rule is applied when the time range with a specified name becomes
active. The ACL rule is removed when the time range with a specified name becomes
inactive.

The vlan and cos parameters refer to the VLAN identifier and 802.1p user priority fields,
respectively, of the VLAN tag. For packets containing a double VLAN tag, this is the first (or
outer) tag.
The assign-queue parameter allows specification of a particular hardware queue for handling
traffic that matches this rule. The allowed <queue-id> value is 0-(n-1), where n is the
number of user configurable queues available for the hardware platform. The
assign-queue parameter is valid only for a permit rule.

      Note: The special command form {deny | permit} any any is used to
            match all Ethernet layer 2 packets, and is the equivalent of the IP
            access list match every rule.
