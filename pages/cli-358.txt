   level, but below the urgent severity level, are emailed in a non-urgent manner by collecting
   them together until the log time expires. You can specify the <severitylevel> value as
   either an integer from 0 to 7 or symbolically through one of the following keywords:
   emergency (0), alert (1), critical (2), error (3), warning (4), notice (5), info (6),
