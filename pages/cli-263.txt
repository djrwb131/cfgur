Class of Service (CoS) Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure and view Class of Service (CoS)
   settings for the switch. The commands in this section allow you to control the priority and
   transmission rate of traffic.

       Note: Commands you issue in the Interface Config mode only affect a single
               interface. Commands you issue in the Global Config mode affect all
               interfaces.

   classofservice dot1p-mapping
   This command maps an 802.1p priority to an internal traffic class. The <userpriority>
   values can range from 0-7. The <trafficclass> values range from 0-6, although the
   actual number of available traffic classes depends on the platform. For more information
   about 802.1p priority, see Voice VLAN Commands on page 65.
