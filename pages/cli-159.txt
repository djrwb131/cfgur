set igmp report-suppression
Use this command to suppress the IGMP reports on a VLAN. In order to optimize the number
of reports traversing the network with no added benefits, a Report Suppression mechanism is
implemented. When more than one client responds to an MGMD query for the same
Multicast Group address within the max-response-time, only the first response is forwarded
to the query and others are suppressed at the switch.

 Default      Disabled

 Format       set igmp report-suppression <1-4093>

 Mode         VLAN Config
