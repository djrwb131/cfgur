ip access-list
This command creates an extended IP access control list (ACL) identified by <name>,
consisting of classification fields defined for the IP header of an IPv4 frame. The <name>
parameter is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string from 1 to 31 characters uniquely
identifying the IP access list.
If an IP ACL by this name exists, this command enters IPv4-Access List config mode to allow
updating the existing IP ACL.

    Note: The CLI mode changes to IPv4-Access-List Config mode when you
           successfully execute this command.

ip access-list rename
This command changes the name of an IP access control list (ACL). The <name> parameter

alphanumeric string from 1 to 31 characters uniquely identifying the IP access list.

{deny | permit} (IP ACL)
This command creates a new rule for the current IP access list. Each rule is appended to the
list of configured rules for the list.

    Note: The no form of this command is not supported, since the rules within
           an IP ACL cannot be deleted individually. Rather, the entire IP ACL
           must be deleted and respecified.
