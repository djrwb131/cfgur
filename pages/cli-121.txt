 Mode          Global Config

no port-channel linktrap

This command disables link trap notifications for the port-channel (LAG). The interface is a
logical slot and port for a configured port-channel. The option all disables link trap
notifications for all the configured port-channels.

port-channel load-balance
This command selects the load-balancing option used on a port-channel (LAG). Traffic is
balanced on a port-channel (LAG) by selecting one of the links in the channel over which to
transmit specific packets. The link is selected by creating a binary pattern from selected fields
in a packet, and associating that pattern with a particular link.
Load-balancing is not supported on every device. The range of options for load-balancing
can vary per device. The switch also supports enhanced hashing mode, which has the
following advantages:
   MODULO-N (where N is the number of active link members in a LAG) operation based on
    the number of ports in the LAG.
   Packet attributes selection based on the packet type: For L2 packets, source and
    destination MAC address are used for hash computation. For L3 packets, source IP,
    destination IP address, TCP/UDP ports are used.
   Non-Unicast traffic and unicast traffic is hashed using a common hash algorithm
   Excellent load balancing performance.
The interface is a logical <slot/port> for a configured port-channel. The option all
enables the configuration for all the configured port-channels. Instead of <slot/port>, you
can use lag <lag-group-id> as an alternate way to specify the LAG interface, in which
<lag-group-id> is the LAG port number.
