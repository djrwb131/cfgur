ip icmp error-interval
Use this command to limit the rate at which IPv4 ICMP error messages are sent. The rate
limit is configured as a token bucket, with two configurable parameters, burst-size and
burst-interval.
   <burst-interval> specifies how often the token bucket is initialized with burst-size
    tokens. burst-interval is from 0 to 2147483647 milliseconds (msec).
   <burst-size> is the number of ICMP error messages that can be sent during one
    burst-interval. The range is from 1 to 200 messages.
To disable ICMP rate limiting, set the burst interval to zero (0).

 Default          burst-interval of 1000 msec.
                  burst-size of 100 messages
