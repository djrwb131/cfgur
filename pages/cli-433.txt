This command sets the RMON alarm entry in the RMON alarm MIB group.

 Format      rmon alarm <alarm-number> <variable> <sample-interval>
             <sampling-type> {rising-threshold <value>} {falling-threshold
             <value>} [startup {rising | falling | rising-falling}] [owner
             <string>]

 Mode        Global Config

 Parameter                   Description

 <alarm-number>              The alarm number that identifies the alarm.

                             variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of integer.

 <sample-interval>           The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared
                             with the rising and falling thresholds. The range is 0 to 2147483647.
                             The default is 0.

 <sampling-type>             The alarm sample type. The method of sampling the selected variable
                             and calculating the value to be compared against thresholds. Possible
                             types are Absolute or Delta.

 rising-threshold <value>    The alarm rising threshold for the sample statistics.

 falling-threshold <value>   The alarm falling threshold for the sample statistics.

 [startup {rising | falling  The alarm that may be sent. Possible values are Rising Alarm, Falling
 | rising-falling}]          Alarm, or both.

 owner <string>              The alarm owner. The owner string associated with the alarm entry.
