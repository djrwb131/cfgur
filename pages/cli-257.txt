                           M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

 Parameter           Description

 <ip-address>        The IPv4 unicast or directed broadcast address to which relayed UDP broadcast
                     packets are sent. The IP address cannot be in a subnet on the interface where the
                     relay entry is configured, and cannot be an IP address configured on any interface
                     of the local router.

 <dest-udp-port>     A destination UDP port number from 0 to 65535.

 port name options   The destination UDP port may be optionally specified by its name. Whether a port is
                     specified by its number or its name has no effect on behavior. The names
                     recognized are as follows:
                       dhcp (port 67)
                       domain (port 53)
                       isakmp (port 500)
                       mobile-ip (port 434)
                       nameserver (port 42)
                       netbios-dgm (port 138)
                       netbios-ns (port 137)
                       ntp (port 123)
                       pim-auto-rp (port 496)
                       rip (port 520)
                       tacacs (port 49)
                       tftp (port 69)
                       time (port 37)
                     Other ports must be specified by number.

no ip helper-address

Use this command to remove the IP address from the previously configured list. The no
command without an <ip-address> argument removes the entire list of helper addresses
on that interface.

 Format       no ip helper-address <ip-address> [<dest-udp-port> | dhcp | domain |
              isakmp | mobile-ip | nameserver | netbios-dgm | netbios-ns | ntp |
              pim-auto-rip | rip | tacacs | tftp | time]

 Mode         Interface Config

ip helper-address discard
Use this command to drop matching packets. Matching packets are discarded rather than
relayed, even if a global ip helper-address configuration matches the packet.

 Format       ip helper-address discard [<dest-udp-port> | dhcp | domain | isakmp
              | mobile-ip | nameserver | netbios-dgm | netbios-ns | ntp |
              pim-auto-rip | rip | tacacs | tftp | time]
