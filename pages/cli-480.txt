aaa authentication login
Use this command to set authentication at login. The default and optional list names created
with the command are used with the aaa authentication login command. Create a list
by entering the aaa authentication login list-name method command, where
list-name is any character string used to name this list. The method argument identifies
the list of methods that the authentication algorithm tries in the sequence.
The additional methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an
error, not if an authentication failure occurs. To ensure that the authentication succeeds even
if all methods return an error, specify none as the final method in the command line. For
example, if none is specified as an authentication method after radius, no authentication is
used if the RADIUS server is down.
If you configure local as the first method in the list, the switch tries no other methods.

 Default         ·  defaultList. Used by the console and only contains the method none.
                 ·  networkList. Used by telnet and SSH and only contains the method local.
