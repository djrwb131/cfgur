Command Syntax

   A command is one or more words that might be followed by one or more parameters.
   Parameters can be required or optional values.
   Some commands, such as show network and clear vlan, do not require parameters.
   Other commands, such as network parms, require that you supply a value after the
   command. You must type the parameter values in a specific order, and optional parameters
   follow required parameters. The following example describes the network parms
   command syntax:

     Format       network parms <ipaddr> <netmask> [gateway]

      network parms is the command name.
      <ipaddr> and <netmask> are parameters and represent required values that you must
       enter after you type the command keywords.
      [gateway] is an optional keyword, so you are not required to enter a value in place of
       the keyword.
   This command line reference manual lists each command by the command name and
   provides a brief description of the command. Each command reference also contains the
   following information:
      Format shows the command keywords and the required and optional parameters.
      Mode identifies the command mode you must be in to access the command.
      Default shows the default value, if any, of a configurable setting on the device.
   The show commands also contain a description of the information that the command shows.
