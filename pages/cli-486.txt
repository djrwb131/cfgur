aaa authorization
The command creates an authorization method list. This list is identified by the default
keyword or by a user-specified <list-name>. If tacacs is specified as the authorization
method, authorization commands are notified to a TACACS+ server. If radius is the
specified authorization method, authorization commands are notified to a RADIUS server. If
none is specified, command authorization is not applicable. You can create up to five
authorization method lists for the commands type.

     Note: The local method is not supported for command authorization.
           Command authorization with RADIUS works only if the applied
           authentication method is also RADIUS.
