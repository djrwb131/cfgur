·   Wildcard masking for ACLs operates differently from a subnet mask. A wildcard mask is
    in essence the inverse of a subnet mask. With a subnet mask, the mask has ones (1's) in
    the bit positions that are used for the network address, and has zeros (0's) for the bit
    positions that are not used. In contrast, a wildcard mask has (0's) in a bit position that
    must be checked. A `1' in a bit position of the ACL mask indicates the corresponding bit
    can be ignored.

access-list
This command creates an IP access control list (ACL) that is identified by the access list
number, which is 1-99 for standard ACLs or 100-199 for extended ACLs.
IP Standard ACL:

 Format     access-list <1-99> {deny | permit} {every | <srcip> <srcmask>} [log]
            [rate-limit <1-4294967295> <1-128>][assign-queue <queue-id>]
            [{mirror | redirect} <slot/port>]

 Mode       Global Config

IP Extended ACL:

 Format     access-list <100-199> {deny | permit} {every | {{icmp | igmp | ip |
            tcp | udp | <number>} {<srcip> <srcmask>} [eq {<portkey> |
            <0-65535>}] {<dstip> <dstmask>} [eq {<portkey>| <0-65535>}]
            [precedence <precedence> | tos <tos> <tosmask> | dscp <dscp>]}}
            [log] [rate-limit <1-4294967295> <1-128>] [assign-queue <queue-id>]
            [{mirror | redirect} <slot/port>]

 Mode       Global Config

 Parameter                     Description
 <1-99> or <100-199>           Range 1­99 is the access list number for an IP standard ACL.
                               Range 100­199 is the access list number for an IP extended ACL.

 {deny | permit}               Specifies whether the IP ACL rule permits or denies an action.

 every                         Match every packet

 {icmp | igmp | ip | tcp |     Specifies the protocol to filter for an extended IP ACL rule.
 udp | <number>}               <number> can be a value from 0-255.

 <srcip> <srcmask>             Specifies a source IP address and source netmask for match
                               condition of the IP ACL rule.
