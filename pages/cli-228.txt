Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure ARP and to view ARP information
   about the switch. ARP associates IP addresses with MAC addresses and stores the
   information as ARP entries in the ARP cache.

   arp
   This command creates an ARP entry. The value for <ipaddress> is the IP address of a
   device on a subnet attached to an existing routing interface. <macaddr> is a unicast MAC
   address for that device.
   The format of the MAC address is 6 two-digit hexadecimal numbers that are separated by
   colons, for example 00:06:29:32:81:40.

     Format        arp <ipaddress> <macaddr>

     Mode          Global Config

   no arp

   This command deletes an ARP entry. The value for <arpentry> is the IP address of the
   interface. The value for <ipaddress> is the IP address of a device on a subnet attached to
   an existing routing interface. <macaddr> is a unicast MAC address for that device.

     Format        no arp <ipaddress> <macaddr>

     Mode          Global Config

   ip local-proxy-arp
   This command enables local-proxy-arp on interface or range of interfaces. The switch only
   responds if all next hops in its route to the destination are through interfaces other than the
   interface that received the ARP request. Enabling local proxy ARP removes this restriction.

     Default       disabled

     Format        ip local-proxy-arp

     Mode          Interface Config

   no ip local-proxy-arp

   This command disables local-proxy-arp on the interface or a range of interfaces.

     Format        no ip local-proxy-arp

     Mode          Interface Config
