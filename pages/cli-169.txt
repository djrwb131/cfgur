set mld interfacemode
Use this command to enable MLD Snooping on all interfaces. If an interface has MLD
Snooping enabled and you enable this interface for routing or enlist it as a member of a
port-channel (LAG), MLD Snooping functionality is disabled on that interface. MLD Snooping
functionality is re-enabled if you disable routing or remove port-channel (LAG) membership
from an interface that has MLD Snooping enabled.

 Default       disabled

 Format        set mld interfacemode

 Mode          Global Config

set mld fast-leave
Use this command to enable MLD Snooping fast-leave admin mode on a selected interface
or VLAN. Enabling fast-leave allows the switch to immediately remove the Layer 2 LAN
interface from its forwarding table entry upon receiving and MLD done message for that
multicast group without first sending out MAC-based general queries to the interface.

    Note: You should enable fast-leave admin mode only on VLANs where only
            one host is connected to each Layer 2 LAN port. This prevents the
            inadvertent dropping of the other hosts that were connected to the
            same layer 2 LAN port but were still interested in receiving multicast
            traffic directed to that group.

    Note: Fast-leave processing is supported only with MLD version 1 hosts.

 Default       disabled

 Format        set mld fast-leave <vlan-id>
