denotes the bit positions in <tosbits> that are used for comparison against the IP TOS field
in a packet. For example, to check for an IP TOS value having bits 7 and 5 set and bit 1 clear,
where bit 7 is most significant, use a <tosbits> value of a0 (hex) and a <tosmask> of a2
(hex).

    Note: The match ip dscp, match ip precedence, and match ip
           tos commands provide alternative ways to specify a match criterion
           for the same Service Type field in the IP header, but each command
           requires a slightly different user notation.

    Note: This "free form" version of the IP DSCP, IP precedence, and IP ToS
           match specification gives you complete control when specifying which
           bits of the IP Service Type field must be checked.

 Default      none

 Format       match ip tos <tosbits> <tosmask>

 Mode         Class-Map Config

match protocol
This command adds to the specified class definition a match condition based on the value of
the IP Protocol field in a packet using a single keyword notation or a numeric value notation.
To specify the match condition using a single keyword notation, the value for
<protocol-name> is one of the supported protocol name keywords. The currently
supported values are: icmp, igmp, ip, tcp, udp. A value of ip matches all protocol number
values.
To specify the match condition using a numeric value notation, the protocol number is a
standard value assigned by IANA and is interpreted as an integer from 0 to 255.

    Note: This command does not validate the protocol number value against
           the current list defined by IANA.

 Default      none

 Format       match protocol {<protocol-name> | <0-255>}
