                            M4100 Series ProSAFE Managed Switches

    Note: The 31-bit subnet mask is only supported on routing interface. This
           feature is not supported on a network port because it acts as a host,
           not a router, on the management interface.

 Format       ip address <ipaddr> {<subnetmask> | /<prefix-length>} [secondary]

 Mode         Interface Config

 Parameter       Description

 <ipaddr>        The IP address of the interface.

 <subnetmask>    A four-digit dotted-decimal number that represents the subnet mask of the interface

 <prefix-length> Implements RFC 3021. Using the / notation of the subnet mask, this is an integer
                 that indicates the length of the subnet mask. Range is 5­32 bits.

no ip address

This command deletes an IP address from an interface. The value for <ipaddr> is the IP
address of the interface in a.b.c.d format where the range for a, b, c, and d is 1-255. The
value for <subnetmask> is a 4-digit dotted-decimal number which represents the subnet
mask of the interface. To remove all of the IP addresses (primary and secondary) configured
on the interface, enter the command no ip address.

 Format       no ip address [<ipaddr> {<subnetmask> | /<prefix-length>}
              [secondary]]

 Mode         Interface Config

ip address dhcp
Use this command to enable the DHCPv4 client on an in-band interface so that it can acquire
network information, such as the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway from a
network DHCP server. When DHCP is enabled on the interface, the system automatically
deletes all manually configured IPv4 addresses on the interface.

 Default      disabled

 Format       ip address dhcp
