ip proxy-arp
This command enables proxy ARP on a router interface. Without proxy ARP, a device only
responds to an ARP request if the target IP address is an address configured on the interface
where the ARP request arrived. With proxy ARP, the device might also respond if the target
IP address is reachable. The device responds only if all next hops in its route to the
destination are through interfaces other than the interface that received the ARP request.
