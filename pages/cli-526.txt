show green-mode
This command displays the green mode configuration and operational status either for the
whole system or for a port. This command can display the per-port configuration and
operational status of the green mode. The status is shown only for the modes supported on
the switch.

 Format        show green-mode [<slot/port>]

 Mode          Privileged Exec

The following table shows the fields that display if you do not specify a slot and port.

 Field                   Definition

 Energy Detect

 Energy-detect Config    Energy-detect Admin mode is enabled or disabled

 Energy-detect Opr       Energy detect mode is currently active or inactive. The energy detect mode might be
                         administratively enabled, but the operational status might be inactive.

 EEE

 EEE Config              EEE Admin Mode is enabled or disabled.

 Global

 Cumulative Energy       Estimated cumulative energy saved per stack in (watts * hours) due to all green
 Saving per Stack        modes enabled

 Current Power           Power consumption by all ports in stack in mWatts.
 Consumption per Stack

 Power Saving            Estimated percentage power saved on all ports in stack due to green mode(s)
