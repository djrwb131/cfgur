Port-Channel/LAG (802.3ad) Commands

   This section describes the commands you use to configure port-channels, which are also
   known as link aggregation groups (LAGs). Link aggregation allows you to combine multiple
   full-duplex Ethernet links into a single logical link. Network devices treat the aggregation as if
   it were a single link, which increases fault tolerance and provides load sharing. The LAG
   feature initially load shares traffic based upon the source and destination MAC address.
   Assign the port-channel (LAG) VLAN membership after you create a port-channel. If you do
   not assign VLAN membership, the port-channel might become a member of the
   management VLAN which can result in learning and switching issues.
   A port-channel (LAG) interface can be either static or dynamic, but not both. All members of a
   port channel must participate in the same protocols.) A static port-channel interface does not
   require a partner system to be able to aggregate its member ports.

       Note: If you configure the maximum number of dynamic port-channels
            (LAGs) that your platform supports, additional port-channels that you
            configure are automatically static.

   addport
   This command adds one port to the port-channel (LAG). The interface is a logical slot/port
   number or a group ID of a configured port-channel.

       Note: Before adding a port to a port-channel, set the physical mode of the
            port. For more information, see speed on page 22.

     Format    addport {<logical slot/port> | lag <lag-group-id>}

   deleteport (Interface Config)
   This command deletes the port from the port-channel (LAG). The interface is a logical
   slot/port number or a group ID of a configured port-channel.

     Format    deleteport {<logical slot/port> | lag <lag-group-id>}
